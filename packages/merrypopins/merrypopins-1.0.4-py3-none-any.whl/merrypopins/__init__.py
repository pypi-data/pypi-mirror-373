===========

A modular pipeline for nanoindentation analysis. Includes tools for:

 - `load_datasets`: Load raw indentation `.txt` and their metadata `.tdm` files into pandas DataFrames.
 - `preprocess`: Clean and normalize indentation data, apply contact point detection.
 - `locate`: Detect pop-in events using methods such as IsolationForest, CNN, Savitzky-Golay, and Finite Differences.
 - `statistics`: Perform statistical analysis and model fitting on located popâ€‘in events (e.g., frequency, magnitude, distribution).
 - `make_dataset`: Construct enriched datasets by running the full pipeline and exporting annotated results and visualizations.
