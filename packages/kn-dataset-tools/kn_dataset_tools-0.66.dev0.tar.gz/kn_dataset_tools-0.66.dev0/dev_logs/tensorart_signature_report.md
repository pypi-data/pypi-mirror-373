# TensorArt Metadata Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 13 TensorArt image samples, I've identified clear and consistent patterns that can be used to detect TensorArt-generated images. The **EMS (EMS-number-EMS.safetensors)** pattern emerges as the primary and most reliable signature for TensorArt detection.

## Key Findings

### 1. Primary Signature: EMS Model Pattern
**Pattern**: `EMS-[digits]-EMS.safetensors`  
**Examples Found**:
- EMS-1045417-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-1097168-EMS.safetensors  
- EMS-526950-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-838355-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-924273-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-974336-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-1010173-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-1041064-EMS.safetensors

**Significance**: This appears to be TensorArt's standard model naming convention. Found in 10+ out of 13 analyzed images.

### 2. Secondary Signature: EMS LoRA Pattern
**Pattern**: `EMS-[digits]-FP8-EMS.safetensors` or `<lora:EMS-[digits]-EMS`  
**Examples Found**:
- EMS-1017214-FP8-EMS.safetensors
- EMS-668630-FP8-EMS.safetensors  
- EMS-829581-FP8-EMS.safetensors

**Significance**: TensorArt uses both standard EMS models and FP8-quantized LoRA versions.

### 3. Job ID Pattern
**Pattern**: 18-digit numeric strings in SaveImage filename_prefix  
**Examples Found**:
- 883289586820738222
- 884233603452703252
- 879831833204823630
- 882289014059746975
- 848699895903819693
- 874161638855650508

**Significance**: These appear to be TensorArt's internal job/generation IDs, consistently 18 digits long.

### 4. TensorArt-Specific ComfyUI Nodes
Advanced users may see these custom nodes:
- **ECHOCheckpointLoaderSimple** - Custom checkpoint loader
- **BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced** - Advanced text encoding
- **LoraTagLoader** - LoRA loading with tags
- **SetSubseeds** / **SetSubseeds_Image** - Seed management
- **KSampler_A1111** - A1111-style sampling
- **NunchakuFluxDiTLoader** - Flux model loader
- **NunchakuFluxLoraLoader** - Flux LoRA loader

**Note**: These are NOT universal - simpler workflows may use standard ComfyUI nodes.

## Detection Strategy

### Recommended Detection Rules (Priority Order)

1. **Primary Rule - EMS Models** (Highest Confidence)
   ```regex
   EMS-\d+-EMS\.safetensors
   ```

2. **Secondary Rule - EMS LoRAs** (High Confidence)  
   ```regex
   EMS-\d+(-FP8)?-EMS\.safetensors
   ```
   ```regex
   <lora:EMS-\d+(-FP8)?-EMS
   ```

3. **Tertiary Rule - Job ID Pattern** (Moderate Confidence)
   ```regex
   "filename_prefix":\s*["\'](\d{18})["\']
   ```

4. **Quaternary Rule - TensorArt Nodes** (Lower Confidence)
   - Presence of ECHOCheckpointLoaderSimple
   - Presence of BNK_CLIPTextEncodeAdvanced
   - Presence of NunchakuFlux* nodes

### Detection Logic
```
IF (EMS model pattern found) THEN
  confidence = "high"
  platform = "TensorArt"
ELSE IF (EMS LoRA pattern found) THEN  
  confidence = "high"
  platform = "TensorArt"
ELSE IF (18-digit job ID + any TensorArt node) THEN
  confidence = "moderate"
  platform = "TensorArt (probable)"
ELSE
  confidence = "low"
  platform = "Unknown"
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### Current TensorArt Parser Updates Needed

The existing TensorArt parser in the dataset tools should be updated to focus primarily on the EMS pattern detection:

1. **Expand EMS Detection Rules**:
   - Add both model and LoRA EMS patterns
   - Include FP8 variants
   - Add text-embedded LoRA detection

2. **Improve Node Detection**:
   - Make TensorArt-specific nodes optional rather than required
   - Focus on EMS patterns as primary detection method

3. **Add Job ID Detection**:
   - Parse SaveImage filename_prefix for 18-digit patterns
   - Use as supporting evidence rather than primary detection

### Universal vs Advanced Detection

- **Universal**: EMS pattern detection (works for all TensorArt users)
- **Advanced**: Custom node detection (only for users with specific workflows)

The EMS pattern is the most reliable universal identifier, as it appears regardless of workflow complexity.

## Sample Coverage

**Analyzed Files**: 13 PNG samples  
**With ComfyUI Metadata**: 11 files  
**With EMS Patterns**: 10+ files  
**With TensorArt Job IDs**: 6 files  
**With Advanced Nodes**: 8+ files  

**Coverage Assessment**: Excellent coverage of EMS patterns across different workflow types.

## Unique TensorArt Characteristics

1. **Standardized Model Naming**: The EMS-number-EMS pattern is unique to TensorArt
2. **Consistent Job IDs**: 18-digit numeric generation IDs
3. **Custom Node Ecosystem**: Specialized ComfyUI nodes for advanced features
4. **FP8 Quantization**: Use of FP8-quantized models for efficiency

## Recommendations for Dataset Tools

1. **Update TensorArt.json parser** to prioritize EMS pattern detection
2. **Add EMS model/LoRA extraction** to metadata output
3. **Include job ID extraction** for generation tracking
4. **Make advanced node detection optional** rather than required
5. **Add confidence scoring** based on multiple signature matches

## False Positive Risk

**Very Low** - The EMS-number-EMS pattern appears to be unique to TensorArt's model distribution system and is highly unlikely to appear in other platforms' workflows.

## Conclusion

The EMS model naming pattern provides a robust, reliable signature for TensorArt detection that works across all user skill levels and workflow types. This should be the primary detection method, with other patterns serving as supporting evidence.
