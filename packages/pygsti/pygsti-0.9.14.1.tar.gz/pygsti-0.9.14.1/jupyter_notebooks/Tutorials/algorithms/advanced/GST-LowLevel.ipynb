    "# Algorithms: low-level interface\n",
    "Once we have data for GST, there are several *algorithms* we can run on it to produce tomographic estimates. Depending on the amount of data you have, and time available for running LinearOperator Set Tomography, one algorithm may be preferable over the others.  **What is typically thought of as \"standard GST\" is the iterative maximum-likelihood optimization implemented by `run_iterative_gst`** which optimizes one or more objective functions iteratively, meaning it daisy-chains multiple optimizations, changing (typically *adding* to) the circuits under consideration or the objective function itself (e.g. from $\\chi^2$ to the log-likelihood).\n",
    "\n",
    "`pygsti` contains two main low-level algorithms that form the base of the GST protocol(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear gate set tomography (LGST)**: Uses short operation sequences to quickly compute a rough (low accuracy) estimate of a model by linear inversion.  The model estimate produced has a very specific form: it holds the dense process matrices of each \"gate\" (or circuit layer) under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Long-sequence gate set tomography (LSGST)**: Minimizes an objective function that quantifies a badness-of-fit between a model and data set.  Here \"sequence\" is synonymous with \"circuit\".  The optimization is performed in stages, using successively larger sets of longer and longer circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, the implementation of these algorithms are found in the `pygsti.algorithms.core` module.  In this tutorial, we'll show how to invoke each of these low-level algorithms directly.  This is probably only useful when building your own protocol that needs to borrow pieces of GST without borrowing the entire protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `pygsti` contains **gauge-optimization** algorithms.  Because the outcome data (the input to the GST algorithms above) only determines a model up to some number of un-physical \"gauge\" degrees of freedom, it is often desirable to optimize the `Model` estimate obtained from a GST algorithm within the space of its gauge freedoms.  This process is called \"gauge-optimization\" and the final part of this tutorial demonstrates how to gauge-optimize a model using various criteria."

    "## Gauge Optimization\n",
    "All gauge optimization algorithms perform essentially the same task - to find the model which optimizes some objective function from within the set or space of models that are gauge-equivalent to some starting set.  This is accomplished in `pygsti` using the following mechanism:\n",
    "- one begins with an initial `ExplicitOpModel`, call it `mdl`, to be gauge-optimized.\n",
    "- a `pygsti.objects.GaugeGroup` instance defines a parameterized group of allowable gauge transformations.  This gauge group must be compatible with the `mdl`'s parameterization, so that `mdl.transform_inplace` (which calls `LinearOperator.transform_inplace` and `SPAMVec.transform_inplace`) is able to process elements of the `GaugeGroup` (obtained via a call to `GaugeGroup.element(params)`).  That is, the gauge transformation must map between models with the *same* parameterization (that give by `mdl`).  Because of the close interplay between a model's parameterization and its allowed gauge transformations, `Model` objects can contain a `GaugeGroup` instance as their `default_gauge_group` member. In many circumstances, `mdl.default_gauge_group` is set to the correct gauge group to use for a given `Model`.\n",
    "- `pygsti.gaugeopt_custom(...)` takes an intial `ExplicitOpModel`, an objective function, and a `GaugeGroup` (along with other optimization parameters) and returns a gauge-optimized `ExplicitOpModel`.  Note that if its `gauge_group` argument is left as `None`, then the model's default gauge group is used.  And objective function which takes a single `ExplicitOpModel` argument and returns a float can be supplied, giving the user a fair amount of flexiblity.\n",
    "- since usually the objective function is one which compares the model being optimized to a fixed \"target\" model, `pygsti.gaugeopt_to_target(...)` is a routine able to perform these common types of gauge optimization.  Instead of an objective function, `gaugeopt_to_target` takes a target `ExplicitOpModel` and additional arguments (see below) from which it constructs a objective function and then calls `gaugeopt_custom`.  It is essetially a convenience routine for constructing common gauge optimization objective functions.  Relevant arguments which affect what objective function is used are:\n",
    "  - `target_model` : the `ExplicitOpModel` to compare against - i.e., the one you want to gauge optimize toward. **Note that this doesn't have to be a set of ideal gates **- it can be any (imperfect) model that reflects your expectations about what the estimates should look like.\n",
    "  - `item_weights` : a dictionary of weights allowing different gates and/or SPAM operations to be weighted differently when computing the objective function's value.\n",
    "  - `CPpenalty` : a prefactor multiplying the sum of all the negative Choi-matrix eigenvalues corresponding to each of the gates.\n",
    "  - `TPpenalty` : a prefactor multiplying the sum of absoulte-value differences between the first row of each operation matrix and `[1 0 ... 0 ]` and the discrpance between the first element of each state preparation vector and its expected value.\n",
    "  - `validSpamPenalty` : a prefactor multiplying penalty terms enforcing the non-negativity of state preparation eigenavlues and that POVM effect eigenvalues lie between 0 and 1.\n",
    "  - `gates_metric` : how to compare corresponding gates in the gauge-optimized and target sets. `\"frobenius`\" uses the frobenius norm (weighted before taking the final sqrt), `\"fidelity\"` uses the *squared process infidelity* (squared to avoid negative-infidelity issues in non-TP models), and `\"tracedist\"` uses the trace distance (weighted after computing the trace distance between corresponding gates).\n",
    "  - `spamMetric` : how to compare corresponding SPAM vectors. `\"frobenius\"` (the default) should be used here, as `\"fidelity\"` and `\"tracedist\"` compare the \"SPAM gates\" -- the outer product of state prep and POVM effect vectors -- which isn't a meaningful metric.\n",
