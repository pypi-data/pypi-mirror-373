    "## What is Binary RB? \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary RB is a streamlined RB method that draws upon the strengths of [Direct RB](RB-DirectRB.ipynb), but uses a highly gate-efficient state preparation and measurement method that allows it to run on many, many more qubits. It has the same core purpose as Clifford RB - quantifying average gate performance - but it is feasable on more qubits, and it provides more directly useful information. BiRB is feasable on 10s or 100s of qubits (it is possible to holistically benchmark around $1/\\epsilon$ qubits if the error rate per-gate per-qubit is around $\\epsilon$).\n",
    " \n",
    "A depth $m$ ($m\\geq 0$) Binary RB circuit consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A layer of random single-qubit gates that prepare a tensor product state that stabilizes a random (non-Identity) Pauli operator.\n",
    "2. A \"core\" circuit consisting of $m$ independently sampled layers of the native Clifford gates in the device, sampled according to a user-specified distribution $\\Omega$. \n",
    "3. A layer of single-qubit gates that transforms the evolved Pauli into a tensor product of Z and I operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each circuit has an associated target Pauli that gets measured at the end. The results of computational basis measurements are processed to determine the result of measuring the target Pauli.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary RB circuits are much shorter than Direct or Clifford RB circuits, but they retain the core randomization properties of both Clifford and Direct RB circuits, and they have a simpler structure than Mirror RB circuits."

    "Exactly as with Direct  and Mirror RB, the circuit layer sampling distribution $\\Omega$ is perhaps the most important input to the Binary RB experiment design. This is because, by construction, the BiRB error rate $r$ is $\\Omega$-dependent. This $\\Omega$-dependence is useful, because by carefully choosing or varying $\\Omega$ we can learn a lot about device performance. But it also means that the $\\Omega$ has to be carefully chosen! At the very least, **you need to know what sampling distribution you are using in order to interpret the results!**\n",
