    "## Standard noise types\n",
    "There are three standard types of noise that can be added to operations in pyGSTi: depolarization, stochastic, and Lindbladian.  The first two types are common in the literature, while the third, \"Lindbladian\", needs a bit more explanation.  Many types of gate errors can be represented in terms of an *error generator*.  If $G$ is a noisy gate (a CPTP map) and $G_0$ is it's ideal counterpart, then if we write $G = e^{\\Lambda}G_0$ then $\\Lambda$ is called the gate's *error generator*.  A `LindbladErrorgen` object, exponentiated using a `ExpErrorgenOp` object represent this $e^{\\Lambda}$ in pyGSTi.  If we write $\\Lambda$ as a sum of terms, $\\Lambda = \\sum_i \\alpha_i F_i + \\sum_{i\\neq j} \\alpha_{ij} F_{ij}$ then, when the $F_i/F_{ij}$ are specific generators for well-known errors (e.g. rotations or stochastic errors), the $\\alpha_i/\\alpha_{ij}$ can roughly be interpreted as the error *rates* corresponding to the well-known error types.  PyGSTi has three specific generator types (where $P_i$ is a Pauli operator or tensor product of Pauli operators):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hamiltonian**: $H_i : \\rho \\rightarrow -i[P_i,\\rho]$\n",
    "- **Stochastic**: $S_i : \\rho \\rightarrow P_i \\rho P_i - \\rho$\n",
    "- **Correlated**: $C_{ij} : \\rho \\rightarrow P_i \\rho P_j + P_j \\rho P_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\{P_i,P_j\\}, \\rho\\}$\n",
    "- **Affine/Active**: $A_{ij} : \\rho \\rightarrow i\\left(P_i \\rho P_j + P_j \\rho P_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\{[P_i,P_j], \\rho\\}\\right)$\n",

    "- `lindblad_error_coeffs`: Values are a dict where the key has the form `(<type>, <basis_elements>)` and the values are the $\\alpha_i$ coefficients in the sum of Lindblad terms, which are then exponentiated to give the final noise. The type includes:\n",

    "#### Noise parameterizations\n",
    "Along with the amount and type of noise added to a model, you can also specify how it is represented as pyGSTi operator objects. This is significant when the model will be tweaked or optimized later on, in which case the paramterization determines how the noise operations are allowed to be tweaked (changed).  Parameterization types are especially important in cloud noise models where this constitutes the entirety of how the model is parameterized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameterizations for the three standard noise types are given by specifying the `depolarization_parameterization`, `stochastic_parameterization`, and `lindblad_parameterization` arguments.  The options for these are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `depolarization_parameterization`:\n",
    "    - `\"depolarize\"` (default) builds `DepolarizeOp` objects with the strength given in `depolarization_strengths`.  A `DepolarizeOp` object contains a single parameter for the depolarization rate.\n",
    "    - `\"stochastic\"` builds `StochasticNoiseOp` objects, which have separate parameters for each Pauli stochastic error rate, all of which are initially equal.  The depolarization strength is thus split evenly among the individual Pauli stochastic channels of a `StochasticNoiseOp`.\n",
    "    - `\"lindblad\"` builds exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` object containing Pauli stochastic terms.  The error generator object is built with `parameterization=\"D\"` (an argument of `LindbladErrorgen.__init__`).  We will refer to this as the *mode* of the `LindbladErrorgen`.  `\"D\"` (depolarization) mode means it that has a single parameter is squared to give the depolarization rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stochastic_parameterization`:\n",
    "    - `\"stochastic\"` (default) builds `StochasticNoiseOp` objects which have separate parameters for each Pauli stochastic error rate.  Elements of `stochastic_error_probs` are used as coefficients in a linear combination of individual Pauli stochastic channels.\n",
    "    - `\"lindblad\"` builds exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` object containing Pauli stochastic terms.  The error generator object is built in `\"CPTP\"` mode, which means it that there is one parameter per stochastic rate (equal to the square root of the rate so it is constrained to be positive).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `lindblad_parameterization`:  Lindblad errors are always represented by exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` objects.  A `LindbladErrorgen` can have several different internal parameterizations, or *modes* as we refer to them here to avoid confusion with the noise or model parameterization.  The mode is by definition the value of the `parameterization` argument supplied to `LindbladErrorgen.__init__`, which influences what types of elementary error generators (e.g. 'H', 'S', 'C' and 'A') are allowed and whether the Pauli stochastic error rates are constrained to be positive. The value of `lindblad_parameterization` can be set to any valid mode value (see documentation for more details).  Usually the default values of `\"auto\"` is fine. \n",
