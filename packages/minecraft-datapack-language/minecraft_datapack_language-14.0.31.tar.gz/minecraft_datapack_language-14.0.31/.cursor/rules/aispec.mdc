- Use the MDL_AI_SPEC_SHEET (living spec doc) to remember the important context. Update it if it is out of date. Do NOT forget to follow the development cycle.
- Make sure to follow the development steps outlines in MDL_AI_SPEC_SHEET. Use mdlbeta to test locally. When you are done, upload the changes and release. Wait 20 seconds. Make sure to upgrade mdl locally too (try 2+ times).
- Use and update the MDL_LANGUAGE_SPEC
- Keep using mdlbeta (re-compile after changes using dev_build.sh) to check (use check-advanced) our sample code and outputs until it is perfect. Remember issues and document them in MDL_AI_SPEC_SHEET.
- Put ALL temp files (inputs/outputs/builds) in the .tmp folder
- Use ./scripts/UpdateMDL.sh to update mdl when testing the changes you just made. Remember this.
