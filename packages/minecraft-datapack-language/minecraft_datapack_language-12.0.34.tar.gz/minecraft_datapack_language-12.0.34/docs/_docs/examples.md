# MDL Examples

This page contains complete, working examples that demonstrate MDL's powerful features for creating Minecraft datapacks.

> **ðŸ“š Need help with MDL syntax?** Check out the [Language Reference](/docs/language-reference/) for complete syntax documentation.

## Hello World

A simple datapack that displays a welcome message and counts how many times it's been called.

```mdl
// hello.mdl
pack "My First Pack" "A simple example" 82;

namespace "example";

var num counter = 0;

function "hello" {
    say Hello, Minecraft!;
    tellraw @a {"text":"Welcome to my datapack!","color":"green"};
    counter = counter + 1;
    say Counter: $counter$;
}

on_load "example:hello";
```

**Build and use:**
```bash
mdl build --mdl hello.mdl -o dist
# Copy dist/My_First_Pack/ to your world's datapacks folder
# Run /reload in-game
```

## Player Counter System

A practical system that counts players and displays statistics.

```mdl
// player_counter.mdl
pack "Player Counter" "Counts and tracks players" 82;

namespace "stats";

var num player_count = 0;
var num total_joins = 0;
var num current_online = 0;

function "count_players" {
    player_count = 0;
    for player in @a {
        player_count = player_count + 1;
    }
    current_online = player_count;
    say Players online: $current_online$;
}

function "player_joined" {
    total_joins = total_joins + 1;
    say Welcome! Total joins: $total_joins$;
    tellraw @a {"text":"A player joined!","color":"green"};
}

function "show_stats" {
    tellraw @a {"text":"=== SERVER STATS ===","color":"gold","bold":true};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Online: $current_online$","color":"aqua"};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Total Joins: $total_joins$","color":"yellow"};
}

on_tick "stats:count_players";
on_tick "stats:show_stats";
```

## Health Monitor

A health monitoring system that alerts when players are low on health.

```mdl
// health_monitor.mdl
pack "Health Monitor" "Monitors player health" 82;

namespace "health";

var num low_health_threshold = 8;
var num critical_health_threshold = 4;

function "check_health" {
    for player in @a {
        if "$player.health$ <= $critical_health_threshold$" {
            tellraw @a {"text":"CRITICAL: $player.name$ is dying!","color":"red","bold":true};
            effect give $player minecraft:regeneration 10 1;
        } else if "$player.health$ <= $low_health_threshold$" {
            tellraw @a {"text":"Warning: $player.name$ is low on health","color":"orange"};
            effect give $player minecraft:resistance 5 0;
        }
    }
}

function "heal_all" {
    for player in @a {
        effect give $player minecraft:instant_health 1 0;
    }
    say All players healed!;
}

on_tick "health:check_health";
```

## Game Timer

A countdown timer system for games and events.

```mdl
// game_timer.mdl
pack "Game Timer" "Countdown timer system" 82;

namespace "timer";

var num time_remaining = 300;  // 5 minutes in seconds
var num game_active = 0;       // 0=waiting, 1=active, 2=finished

function "start_game" {
    game_active = 1;
    time_remaining = 300;
    say Game started! 5 minutes remaining;
    tellraw @a {"text":"GAME STARTED!","color":"green","bold":true};
}

function "update_timer" {
    if "$game_active$ == 1" {
        time_remaining = time_remaining - 1;
        
        if "$time_remaining$ <= 0" {
            game_active = 2;
            say Game over! Time's up!;
            tellraw @a {"text":"GAME OVER!","color":"red","bold":true};
        } else if "$time_remaining$ % 60 == 0" {
            var num minutes = $time_remaining$ / 60;
            say $minutes$ minutes remaining;
        } else if "$time_remaining$ <= 10" {
            say $time_remaining$ seconds remaining!;
        }
    }
}

function "show_time" {
    if "$game_active$ == 1" {
        var num minutes = $time_remaining$ / 60;
        var num seconds = $time_remaining$ % 60;
        tellraw @a {"text":"Time: $minutes$:$seconds$","color":"yellow"};
    }
}

on_tick "timer:update_timer";
on_tick "timer:show_time";
```

## Score System

A comprehensive scoring system with leaderboards.

```mdl
// score_system.mdl
pack "Score System" "Player scoring and leaderboards" 82;

namespace "score";

var num player1_score = 0;
var num player2_score = 0;
var num player3_score = 0;
var num high_score = 0;

function "add_points" {
    // Simulate points being earned
    player1_score = player1_score + 10;
    player2_score = player2_score + 15;
    player3_score = player3_score + 8;
    
    // Update high score
    if "$player1_score$ > $high_score$" {
        high_score = player1_score;
    }
    if "$player2_score$ > $high_score$" {
        high_score = player2_score;
    }
    if "$player3_score$ > $high_score$" {
        high_score = player3_score;
    }
}

function "show_leaderboard" {
    tellraw @a {"text":"=== LEADERBOARD ===","color":"gold","bold":true};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Player 1: $player1_score$","color":"aqua"};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Player 2: $player2_score$","color":"aqua"};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Player 3: $player3_score$","color":"aqua"};
    tellraw @a {"text":"High Score: $high_score$","color":"yellow","bold":true};
}

function "reset_scores" {
    player1_score = 0;
    player2_score = 0;
    player3_score = 0;
    say All scores reset!;
}

on_tick "score:add_points";
on_tick "score:show_leaderboard";
```

    var num final_damage = base_damage * $damage_multiplier$;
    
    if "$critical_chance$ >= 10" {
        final_damage = final_damage * 2;
        say Critical hit! Damage: $final_damage$;
    } else {
        say Normal attack! Damage: $final_damage$;
    }
}

namespace "weather";

var num weather_state = 0;  // 0=clear, 1=rain, 2=storm, 3=snow
var num weather_duration = 0;
var num max_duration = 1200;  // 20 seconds

function "set_clear" {

        } else if "$weather_state$ == 1" {
            function weather:set_rain;
        } else if "$weather_state$ == 2" {
            function weather:set_storm;
        } else {
            function weather:set_snow;
        }
    }
}

on_tick "weather:cycle_weather";
```

## Registry Examples

### Custom Recipes

```mdl
// recipes.mdl
pack "Custom Recipes" "Custom crafting recipes" 82;

namespace "custom";

// Reference external JSON files
recipe "diamond_sword" "recipes/diamond_sword.json";
recipe "custom_pickaxe" "recipes/custom_pickaxe.json";

function "announce_recipes" {
    say Custom recipes loaded!;
    tellraw @a {"text":"Custom recipes available!","color":"green"};
}

on_load "custom:announce_recipes";
```

### Custom Loot Tables

```mdl
// loot.mdl
pack "Custom Loot" "Custom loot tables" 82;

namespace "loot";

loot_table "diamond_sword" "loot_tables/diamond_sword.json";
loot_table "treasure_chest" "loot_tables/treasure_chest.json";

function "spawn_treasure" {
    say Spawning treasure chest...;
    summon chest ~ ~ ~ {LootTable:"loot:treasure_chest"};
    tellraw @a {"text":"Treasure chest spawned!","color":"gold"};
}
```

## Building and Testing

All examples can be built and tested:

```bash
# Build any example
mdl build --mdl example.mdl -o dist

# Copy to your world's datapacks folder
cp -r dist/* ~/.minecraft/saves/YourWorld/datapacks/

# Reload in-game
/reload
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

These examples showcase MDL's powerful features:

- **Variables**: Number variables with expressions and arithmetic
- **Control Flow**: If/else statements and while loops
- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks with parameters
- **Hooks**: Automatic execution with `on_load` and `on_tick`
- **Multi-file**: Modular projects with namespace separation
- **Registry Types**: Recipes, loot tables, and other Minecraft content
- **Player Interaction**: Commands that respond to player actions
- **Real-time Systems**: Timers, counters, and monitoring systems

Each example is complete, tested, and ready to use in your Minecraft world!
