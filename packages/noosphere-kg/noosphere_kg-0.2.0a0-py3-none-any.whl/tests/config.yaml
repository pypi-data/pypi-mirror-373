prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant that helps with building a graph of biological relationships.
  Just ignore human names, locations, etc.
  Just focus in microbial and host entities, environment and conditions entities, microbial-to-microbial relationships, plant-to-microbial relationships, microbial-to-host relationships, etc.
  The 'Reference' word refers to a reference to a paper used to find the information.
  Does not use image references for nodes or relationships.
#  Feel free to create new nodes and relationships that are not in the list of allowed nodes and relationships.
#  Feel free to create new properties that are not in the list of allowed properties.
#  The 'Author' word refers to the author of the paper.

#additional_instructions: |
#  You should build a graph of the relationships.
