               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Piquasso is an open-source Python library for simulating photonic quantum computers.
</p>

> This is a research project, bugs can be expected. If you encounter any, please report
> it in the [Issues page](https://github.com/Budapest-Quantum-Computing-Group/piquasso/issues).

## Basic example

```python
import numpy as np
import piquasso as pq

with pq.Program() as program:
    pq.Q(0) | pq.Displacement(
        r=np.sqrt(2), phi=np.pi / 4
    )  # Displace the state on mode 0.
    pq.Q(0, 1) | pq.Beamsplitter(
        theta=0, phi=np.pi / 2
    )  # Use a beamsplitter gate on modes 0, 1.

    pq.Q(0) | pq.ParticleNumberMeasurement()  # Measurement on mode 0.

simulator = pq.GaussianSimulator(
    d=3, config=pq.Config(hbar=2)
)  # Prepare a Gaussian vacuum state

result = simulator.execute(program, shots=10)  # Apply the program with 10 shots.

print("Resulting state:", result.state)
print("Detected samples:", result.samples)
```

This code outputs:
```
Resulting state: <piquasso._simulators.gaussian.state.GaussianState object at 0x7f3ef3604ac0>
Detected samples: [(0,), (2,), (1,), (2,), (2,), (4,), (1,), (1,), (4,), (1,)]
```

For more details, please refer to [the Piquasso documentation](https://piquasso.readthedocs.io/).

## Install

Piquasso and its dependencies can be installed via pip:

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [https://piquasso.readthedocs.io/](https://piquasso.readthedocs.io/).

## How to contribute?

We welcome people who want to make contributions to Piquasso, be it big or small! If you are considering larger contributions to the source code, please contact us first.

We welcome bug reports, suggestions, and any feedback about Piquasso. To share these, open an issue or fill out the [Piquasso User Survey](https://forms.gle/urLy5S3kYs143ags6).

## Development guide

To install development dependencies, use:
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For document generation one should use
```
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```
Additionally, `pandoc` needs to be installed. To building the documentation, execute
`make html` in the `docs` folder. After a successful build, the documentation is
available under `docs/_build`.

For running files under `benchmarks/` or `scripts/`, please issue
```
pip install -e ".[benchmark]"
```

For building Piquasso, one also needs to install build dependencies:
```
pip install 'pybind11[global]' scikit-build-core cmake
```

### Linux

To build Piquasso for local development on Linux, run
```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```
Here, the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)` flag is needed to copy shared libraries into
the source tree for development.

### Windows

1. Open a terminal (e.g., Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Navigate (`cd`) to the root directory of the Piquasso project.
3. Run the following command:
```
build.bat
```

The `build.bat` script automatically runs all the required commands for building the project.

Alternatively, you can run the commands manually for building the project:
```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="%cd%" -DPYBIND11_FINDPYTHON=ON
cmake --build build --config Debug
cmake --install build --config Debug
```

### Testing

All tests and additional checks can be run using `tox`. After installation, run the
following command:
```
tox -e py312
```

Alternatively, you can run only the tests using `pytest`. After installation, run the
following command:
```
pytest tests
```

Besides testing, we have several additional checks:

1. We use an automatic formatting tool called `black`. To run automatic formatting, simply
   execute
   ```
   black .
   ```
2. Moreover, we also use a linter called `flake8`, which can be executed by issuing
   ```
   flake8
   ```
3. Finally, we use a static type checker called `mypy` on the `piquasso` folder:
   ```
   mypy piquasso
   ```
