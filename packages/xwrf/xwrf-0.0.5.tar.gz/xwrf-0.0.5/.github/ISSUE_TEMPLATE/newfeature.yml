        Describe the new feature and what it needs to do.  Don't talk about how
        it should be implemented unless necessary, that's for the next section.
        This is where you get to say what the feature *does*, but now *how* it
        does it.

        Give some examples of how this new feature will be used.  This should be
        the starting point for tests that need to be implemented when this feature
        is complete.  This is where you get to say how you know if what was
        implemented is *correct* or not.  Even if you don't know how to
        implement this new feature, you should be able to say how you know if
        it is working, so put your thoughts here.
