# Abstract Base Classes

The `multicollections.abc` module provides abstract base classes for multi-mapping collections. These classes define the interface for multi-mappings and provide useful default implementations for common operations.

## Overview

Multi-mappings are collections that can hold multiple values for the same key. The abstract base classes in this module provide a foundation for implementing such collections:

- **`MultiMapping`**: Read-only interface for multi-mappings
- **`MutableMultiMapping`**: Mutable interface that extends `MultiMapping`
