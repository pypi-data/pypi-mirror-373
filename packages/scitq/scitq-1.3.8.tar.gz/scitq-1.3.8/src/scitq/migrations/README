Single-database configuration for Flask.


# To create migrations

```bash
cd src/scitq
SCITQ_PRODUCTION=1 FLASK_APP=server flask db migrate -m "Some description of the migration"
```

# To apply migrations

```bash
cd src/scitq
SCITQ_PRODUCTION=1 FLASK_APP=server flask db upgrade 
```

# Troubleshoot

Whenever you run into this error:
```bash
ERROR [flask_migrate] Error: Target database is not up to date.
```

Which might happen at either above step, the solution is generally to:
```bash
SCITQ_PRODUCTION=1 FLASK_APP=server flask db stamp head 
```
