# Collateral Smart Contract for Bittensor

> **Purpose**: Manage miner collaterals in the Bittensor ecosystem, allowing validators to slash misbehaving miners.
>
> **Design**: One collateral contract per validator and subnet.

This smart contract is **generic** and works with **any Bittensor subnet**.  

## ⚖️ A Note on Slashing Philosophy

The power to slash collateral carries weight — it protects subnet quality, but also risks abuse if unchecked.  
This contract encourages **automated enforcement** wherever possible, ensuring consistency and fairness across validators.

Manual slashing is supported for edge cases where misbehavior is clear but not yet detectable by automated logic.
However, validators should approach this capability **with restraint and responsibility**.  
Every manual slash must be:

- **Justified** — supported by strong evidence (logs, signatures, links).
- **Transparent** — the justification URL and content hash are stored on-chain.
- **Proportional** — reflecting the severity and intent of the violation.

Whenever possible, validators are encouraged to **automate detection and slashing logic** so that actions are data-driven and reproducible.
Automation helps ensure miners are treated consistently across validators — and enables **retroactive enforcement** without requiring on-the-spot judgment.

Slashing is a **last-resort accountability tool**, not a convenience.  
Validators who use it impulsively risk undermining miner trust — and their own reputation.

This model is designed for **trust-minimized collaboration**, not permissionless aggression.  
Use slashing to **protect the network**, not to punish disagreement.

## Overview

This contract creates a **trust-minimized interaction** between miners and validators in the Bittensor ecosystem. 

- **Miners Lock Collateral**
  
  Miners demonstrate their commitment by staking collateral into the validator's contract. Miners can now specify an **executor UUID** during deposit to associate their collateral with specific executors.

- **Collateral-Based Prioritization**

  Validators may choose to favor miners with higher collateral when assigning tasks, incentivizing greater stakes for reliable performance.

- **Arbitrary Slashing**
  
  Validators can penalize a misbehaving miner by slashing any portion of the miner's collateral.

- **Automatic Release**

  If a validator does not respond to a miner's reclaim request within a configured deadline, the miner can reclaim their stake, preventing indefinite lock-ups.

- **Trustless & Auditable**
  
  All operations (deposits, reclaims, slashes) are publicly logged on-chain, enabling transparent oversight for both validators and miners.

- **Off-Chain Justifications**

  Functions `slashCollateral`, `reclaimCollateral`, and `denyReclaim` include URL fields (and content MD5 checksums) to reference off-chain
  explanations or evidence for each action, ensuring decisions are transparent and auditable.

- **Configurable Minimum Bond & Decision Deadline**
  
  Defines a minimum stake requirement and a strict timeline for validator responses.

> **Important Notice on Addressing**
>
> This contract uses **H160 (Ethereum) addresses** for both miner and validator identities.
> - Before interacting with the contract (depositing, slashing, reclaiming, etc.), **all parties must have an Ethereum wallet** (including a plain text private key) to sign the required transactions.
> - An association between these H160 wallet addresses and the respective **SS58 hotkeys** (used in Bittensor) is **strongly recommended** so validators can reliably identify miners.
> - Best practices for managing and verifying these address associations are still under development within the broader Bittensor ecosystem, but Subtensor is now able to [associate H160 with an UID](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/pull/1487)

> **Transaction Fees**
>
> All on-chain actions (deposits, slashes, reclaims, etc.) consume gas, so **both miners and validators must hold enough TAO in their Ethereum (H160) wallets** to cover transaction fees.
> - Make sure to keep a sufficient balance to handle any deposits, reclaims, or slashes you need to perform.
> - Convert H160 to SS58 ([`celium_collateral_contracts/h160_to_ss58.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/h160_to_ss58.py) to transfer TAO to it.
> - You can transfer TAO back to your SS58 wallet when no more contract interactions are required. See [`scripts/celium_collateral_contracts.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/celium_collateral_contracts.py).

## Collateral Smart Contract Lifecycle

Below is a typical sequence for integrating and using this collateral contract within a Bittensor subnet:

- **Subnet Integration**
   - The subnet owner **updates validator software** to prioritize miners with higher collateral when assigning tasks.
   - Validators adopt this updated code and prepare to enforce collateral requirements.

- **Owner Deployment**
   - The owner **creates an Ethereum (H160) wallet**, links it to their hotkey, and funds it with enough TAO to cover transaction fees.
   - The owner **deploys the contract**, requiring participating miners to stake collateral.
   - The owner **publishes the contract address** on-chain, allowing miners to discover and verify it.
   - Once ready, the owner **enables collateral-required mode** and prioritizes miners based on their locked amounts.

- **Miner Deposit**
   - Each miner **creates an Ethereum (H160) wallet**, links it to their hotkey, and funds it with enough TAO for transaction fees.
   - Miners **retrieve** the owner's contract address from the chain or another trusted source.
   - Upon confirmation, miners **deposit** collateral by calling the contract's `deposit(executorUuid)` function, specifying the **executor UUID** to associate the collateral with specific executors.
   - Confirm on-chain that your collateral has been successfully locked for that miner - [`celium_collateral_contracts/get_miners_collateral.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/get_miners_collateral.py)
   - Confirm on-chain that your collateral has been successfully locked for that your executor - [`celium_collateral_contracts/get_miners_collateral.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/get_executor_collateral.py)

- **Slashing Misbehaving Miners**
   - If a miner is found violating subnet rules (e.g., returning invalid responses), the validator **calls** `slashCollateral()` with the `miner`, `slashAmount`, `executorUuid`, and other details to penalize the miner by reducing their staked amount.

- **Reclaiming Collateral**
   - When miners wish to withdraw their stake, they **initiate a reclaim** by calling `reclaimCollateral()`, specifying the **executor UUID** associated with the collateral.
   - If the validator does not deny the request before the deadline, miners (or anyone) can **finalize** it using `finalizeReclaim()`, thus unlocking and returning the collateral.

## Usage Guides

Below are step-by-step instructions tailored to **miners**, **validators**, and **subnet owners**.
Refer to the repository's [`celium_collateral_contracts/`](/celium_collateral_contracts/) folder for sample implementations and helper scripts.

## As a Miner, you can:

- **Deposit Collateral**
  If you plan to stake for multiple validators, simply repeat these steps for each one:
  - Obtain the validator's contract address (usually via tools provided by the subnet owner).
  - Verify that code deployed at the address is indeed the collateral smart contract, the trustee and netuid kept inside are as expected - see [`celium_collateral_contracts/verify_contract.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/verify_contract.py).
  - Run [`celium_collateral_contracts/deposit_collateral.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/deposit_collateral.py) to initiate the deposit transaction with your specified amount of $TAO.
  - Confirm on-chain that your collateral has been successfully locked for that validator - [`celium_collateral_contracts/get_miners_collateral.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/get_miners_collateral.py)

- **Reclaim Collateral**
  - Initiate the reclaim process by running [`celium_collateral_contracts/reclaim_collateral.py`](/scripts/reclaim_collateral.py) with your desired withdrawal amount.
  - Wait for the validator's response or for the configured inactivity timeout to pass.
  - If the validator does not deny your request by the deadline, run [`celium_collateral_contracts/finalize_reclaim.py`](/celium_collateral_contracts/finalize_reclaim.py) to unlock and retrieve your collateral.
  - Verify on-chain that your balance has been updated accordingly.


### As a Owner, you can:

- **Deploy the Contract**
  - Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
    ```bash
    # Install Forge
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash  
    source /home/ubuntu/.bashrc  # Or start a new terminal session
    foundryup
    forge --version
    ```
  - Clone this repository.
  - Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pdm install
    ```
  - Compile and deploy the contract, use [`deploy.sh`](/deploy.sh) with your details as arguments.
  - Record the deployed contract address and publish it via a subnet-owner-provided tool so that miners can discover and verify it.

  ## UUPS Proxy Deployment (Upgradeability)

  This contract uses the **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) proxy pattern** to enable seamless upgrades without losing contract state.  
  With UUPS, the proxy contract holds all storage and delegates logic to an implementation contract. When you upgrade, you deploy a new implementation and point the proxy to it—**all balances and mappings are preserved**.

  ### Deployment Steps

  1. **Install dependencies:**
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

  2. **Deploy or upgrade the contract:**

    ## Deploy on localnet
      ```bash
      bash build.sh
      rm -rf deployments.json
      export RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:9944"
      export PRIVATE_KEY="434469242ece0d04889fdfa54470c3685ac226fb3756f5eaf5ddb6991e1698a3"
      export MIN_COLLATERAL_INCREASE=1000000000000000
      export DENY_TIMEOUT=3600
      export NET_UID=1
      bash deploy.sh
      ```

    ## Deploy on testnet
      ```bash
      bash build.sh
      rm -rf deployments.json
      export RPC_URL="https://test.finney.opentensor.ai"
      export PRIVATE_KEY="434469242ece0d04889fdfa54470c3685ac226fb3756f5eaf5ddb6991e1698a3"
      export MIN_COLLATERAL_INCREASE=1000000000000000
      export DENY_TIMEOUT=3600
      export NET_UID=1
      bash deploy.sh
      ```

     ## Deploy on mainnet
      ```bash
      bash build.sh
      rm -rf deployments.json
      export RPC_URL="https://lite.chain.opentensor.ai"
      export PRIVATE_KEY="434469242ece0d04889fdfa54470c3685ac226fb3756f5eaf5ddb6991e1698a3"
      export MIN_COLLATERAL_INCREASE=1000000000000000
      export DENY_TIMEOUT=3600
      export NET_UID=1
      bash deploy.sh
      ```

    ### Result

    ```

    Final contract address is 0x91d1b1BF9539Cd535402FDE0FC30417CaF8CC631

  This script will:
  - Deploy the implementation contract if needed.
  - Deploy the proxy contract (if not already deployed) or upgrade it to the latest implementation.
  - Save deployment addresses to `deployments.json`.

  **Always interact with the proxy address for all contract calls.**

  ---

- **Enable Regular Operation**
  - Enable the deployed contract address in your owner's code (provided by the subnet owner), so that
    - task assignment prioritizes miners with higher collateral balances.
    - misbehaviour checks causing slashing are automated.

- **Monitor Activity**
  - Use Ethereum JSON-RPC API or a blockchain explorer to view events (`Deposit`, `ReclaimProcessStarted`, `Slashed`, `Reclaimed`).
  - Query contract mappings (`collaterals`, `reclaims`) to check staked amounts and pending reclaim requests.
  - Maintain a local script or UI to stay updated on changes in miner collateral.

- **Manually Deny a Reclaim**
  - Identify the relevant `reclaimRequestId` (from `ReclaimProcessStarted` event, for example).
  - Use [`scripts/deny_reclaim.py`](/scripts/deny_reclaim.py) (calling the contract's `denyReclaim(reclaimRequestId)`) before the deadline.
  - Verify on-chain that the reclaim request is removed and the miner's `hasPendingReclaim` is reset to `false`.

- **Manually Slash Collateral**
  - Confirm miner misconduct based on subnetwork rules (e.g., invalid blocks, spam, protocol violations).
  - Use [`scripts/slash_collateral.py`](/scripts/slash_collateral.py) (calling the contract's `slashCollateral(miner, slashAmount, executorUuid)`) to penalize the miner by reducing their staked amount.
  - Verify the transaction on-chain and confirm the miner's `collaterals[miner]` value has changed.

### As a Subnet Owner, you can

- **Provide Deployment Tools for contract owner**
  
  Offer a script <!--(e.g. built on top of [`scripts/deploy.sh`](todo-link))--> to help contract owner:
  - Create H160 wallet & assosiate it with their SS58.
  - Transfer Tao.
  - Deploy the contract.
  - Publish the resulting contract address (e.g., as a knowledge commitment) so miners can easily verify and deposit collateral.

- **Provide Tools for Miners**
  
  Offer a script that retrieves a list of active validator contract addresses from your on-chain registry or other trusted source.
  This helps miners discover the correct contract for depositing collateral.

- **Track Miner Collateral Usage**
  - Query each validator's contract (using, for example, a script based on [`scripts/get_collaterals.py`](/scripts/get_collaterals.py)) to see how much collateral is staked by each miner.
  - Aggregate this data into a subnet-wide dashboard for real-time oversight of miner participation.
    <!-- - Check out the [ComputeHorde Grafana chart](https://grafana.bactensor.io/d/subnet/metagraph-subnet?var-subnet=12) for a real-world example.-->

- **Facilitate Result-Based Slashing**
  
  Provide validators with automated checks that periodically verify a small subset (e.g., 1–2%) of the miner's submissions.
  If a miner's responses fall below the desired quality threshold, the code should call `slashCollateral()` to penalize substandard performance.
  For example, in the [ComputeHorde SDK](https://sdk.computehorde.io/), slashing is triggered via the [`report_cheated_job()`](https://sdk.computehorde.io/master/api/client.html#compute_horde_sdk.v1.ComputeHordeClient.report_cheated_job) method.

- **Facilitate Collateral Verification**
  
  Provide validator code that checks each miner's staked amount before assigning tasks. This code can:
  - Prioritize miners who have staked more collateral.
  - Reject miners who do not meet a minimum collateral requirement.

  By coupling task assignment with the collateral balance, the subnetwork ensures more consistent performance and discourages low-quality or malicious contributions.


## FAQ

### Why should miners deposit into the smart contract?
Depositing collateral not only demonstrates a miner's commitment to the network and ensures accountability but also enables them to become eligible for mining rewards. The miners who didn't deposit collateral or penalized won't get any rewards.

### When will a miner's deposit be slashed?
Validator will slash when miner stop rental container. so customer lost SSH access to the rental container;

### When will a miner's reclaim request be declined?
Miner's reclaim request will be declined when his executor is rented by customer in the platform. 

### What will happen when a miner's deposit is slashed?
Miner will lose deposited amount for violated executor; miner need to deposit for that executor again if they want to keep getting rewards for executor. 

### How can we keep smart contract states during deployment?
To preserve contract states during deployment, ensure that the contract's storage variables and mappings are migrated correctly. Use tools like `forge` or custom scripts to verify and transfer state data between deployments.
