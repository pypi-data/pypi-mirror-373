# MONAPipe

MONAPipe stands for "Modes of Narration and Attribution Pipeline". It provides natural-language-processing tools for German, implemented in Python/spaCy. In addition to spaCy's default components, MONAPipe adds specific custom components and models for Digital Humanities and Computational Literary Studies.

MONAPipe was originally created in the project group [MONA](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/mona/626918.html) and is now further developed within the [Text+](https://text-plus.org/) infrastructure.
