Please help me contextualize some text. The purpose of this is to explain the content of the given text.

{% if context %}
  This is the context I have so far:
  [start context]
  {{ context }}
  [end context]

  Please update the context (if necessary) so that it incorporates the new information:
{% else %}
  Please return the context for the following text (what is this text about?):
{% endif %}

[start text to contextualize]
{{ chunk }}
[end text to contextualize]

ONLY respond with the updated context and nothing else. ONLY respond with declarative statements about the text. DO NOT EXCEED 200 characters. DO NOT reference the text directly, just say what it is.
