    Leadership is used to ensure some plugins are run by only one worker at a
    time. For example, we wouldn't want every worker running database pruning
    every 60 seconds, as that would be immensely wasteful. Most other plugins
    require a Leadership plugin to be enabled.

    .. note::

        This plugin is enabled by default, you only need to provide it in the
        list of plugins to customize its arguments or if ``no_default_plugins``
        is set to ``True``.

    Implementation
    --------------
    The plugin implements a simple database-backed leader election system
    through a 'leader' table with the following characteristics:

    - Uses a single row with ID=1 to track the current leader worker.
    - Workers attempt to insert/update this row with their worker_id and an
      expiration timestamp.
    - Leadership is acquired when a worker successfully inserts the row (when
      no leader exists) or when the previous leader's entry has expired.
    - The leader renews its leadership by updating its expiration timestamp
      during each poll cycle.
    - If leadership renewal fails, the worker loses its leader status.
    - When a worker gains or loses leadership, appropriate notifications are
      sent via ``leadership.gained``, ``leadership.lost``, and
      ``leadership.renewed`` events.
    - Worker leadership status is tracked via a worker.is_leader event flag.

    :param poll_interval: The number of seconds between leadership poll
                          intervals.
    :param timeout: The number of seconds before a worker is considered to have
                    lost leadership.
