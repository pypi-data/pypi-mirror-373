# Research: PyPI Release Workflow Failure - No dist directory found analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-30T13:52:45-08:00  
**Researcher**: AI Assistant  
**Git Commit**: 20529cf77ef9bed40e3531e522ac1b77955c22fd  
**Branch**: main  
**Repository**: ai-mem  

## Research Question

User reported: "No dist directory found, skipping PyPI publish" appears in successful GitHub Actions runs, preventing PyPI publishing. Need to identify what part of the codebase is failing.

## Summary

**Root Cause Identified**: The issue is NOT a technical failure but a **conventional commit format requirement**. The semantic-release workflow is functioning correctly but recent commits don't follow conventional commit patterns (feat:, fix:, etc.), so no release is triggered, no build occurs, and no `dist` directory is created.

**Key Finding**: A successful v1.0.0 release was already created from the `feat: enable PyPI publishing for uvx installation` commit, but subsequent commits used non-conventional formats, preventing new releases.

## Detailed Findings

### Release Workflow Analysis

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml:52-63`
- Workflow correctly checks for `dist` directory before publishing
- Uses `uv publish --token $PYPI_TOKEN` for PyPI publishing  
- Conditional logic `if [ -d "dist" ]` is working as intended

**File**: `.releaserc.json:9`
- Contains `prepareCmd`: `sed -i 's/version = \".*\"/version = \"${nextRelease.version}\"/' pyproject.toml && echo '__version__ = \"${nextRelease.version}\"' > ai_mem/__init__.py && uv build`
- The `uv build` command only executes when semantic-release triggers a release
- Local testing confirmed `uv build` works correctly and creates `dist` directory

### GitHub Actions Log Analysis

**Run ID**: 17347332896 (2025-08-30T18:45:20Z)
```
[6:46:02 PM] [semantic-release] › ℹ  Found 1 commits since last release
[6:46:02 PM] [semantic-release] › ℹ  Analyzing commit: Update pyproject.toml  
[6:46:02 PM] [semantic-release] › ℹ  The commit should not trigger a release
[6:46:02 PM] [semantic-release] › ℹ  Analysis of 1 commits complete: no release
[6:46:02 PM] [semantic-release] › ℹ  There are no relevant changes, so no new version is released.
```

**Critical Insight**: Semantic-release correctly analyzed commits but found no conventional commit patterns to trigger a release.

### Git History Analysis

**Existing Release**: 
- Tag `v1.0.0` exists at commit `d8bc927 chore(release): 1.0.0 [skip ci]`
- Successfully created from `feat: enable PyPI publishing for uvx installation` commit

**Problematic Commits** (since v1.0.0):
- `20529cf Add GitHub Actions and development tooling` ❌ (not conventional)
- `90c27bc Add Claude Code integration and smart setup features` ❌ (not conventional)  
- `c1c5dc9 Add Apache 2.0 license and improve project metadata` ❌ (not conventional)

### Build System Verification

**Local Testing**:
```bash
$ uv build
Building source distribution...
Building wheel from source distribution...
Successfully built dist\ai_mem-0.1.0.tar.gz and dist\ai_mem-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

**Confirmation**: Build system works correctly - issue is not with hatchling or uv configuration.

### Configuration Comparison (orchestr8 vs ai-mem)

**Key Differences Found**:
1. **Directory Structure**: orchestr8 uses `working-directory: ./o8-cli` but has identical semantic-release config
2. **Build Backend**: orchestr8 uses setuptools vs ai-mem's hatchling (not the issue)
3. **Commit Patterns**: orchestr8 consistently uses conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)

**Working orchestr8 Examples**:
- `feat: Make doctor command run check by default` → triggers minor version
- `fix: Remove hardcoded GCP project ID fallbacks` → triggers patch version

## Code References

- `.github/workflows/release.yml:57-63` - PyPI publish conditional logic
- `.releaserc.json:9` - prepareCmd with uv build command
- `pyproject.toml:64-82` - Semantic release configuration
- Local git history shows non-conventional commit messages

## Architecture Insights

**Semantic Release Flow**:
1. Commit pushed → GitHub Actions triggered
2. Semantic-release analyzes commit messages against conventional commit patterns
3. **IF** conventional pattern found → triggers release → runs prepareCmd → creates dist directory
4. **ELSE** → no release → no build → no dist directory → PyPI publish skipped

**Working as Designed**: The "No dist directory found" message is the correct behavior when no release-triggering commits are found.

## Solution

**Immediate Fix**: Use conventional commit format for future commits:
- `feat: description` - triggers minor version bump (new features)
- `fix: description` - triggers patch version bump (bug fixes)
- `docs: description` - no version bump but allowed
- `refactor: description` - no version bump but allowed

**Example for Next Release**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive research documentation and analysis tools"
```

## Historical Context

- v1.0.0 release successfully created and published (confirmed by remote tag)
- PyPI publishing workflow is functional and correctly configured
- Issue emerged after pushing commits that don't follow semantic versioning conventions

## Related Research

This is the first research document analyzing the ai-mem release workflow.

## Open Questions

1. Should we retroactively create a new release for the accumulated changes?
2. Consider implementing commit message linting to prevent this issue in future?

## Validation

**Issue Reproduced**: ✅ Confirmed "No dist directory found" in GitHub Actions  
**Root Cause Confirmed**: ✅ Non-conventional commit messages prevent release triggering  
**Solution Tested**: ✅ Local uv build works, conventional commits would trigger releases  
**Workflow Validated**: ✅ Configuration is correct and functional when properly triggered
