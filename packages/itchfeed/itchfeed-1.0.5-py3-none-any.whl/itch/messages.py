        Splits a 6-byte timestamp (48 bits) into two 32-bit unsigned integers.

        The ITCH protocol defines the timestamp as a **6-byte (48-bit) unsigned integer**.
        Python's native `struct` module does not support 6-byte integers, so we manage
        the timestamp as a 64-bit integer for simplicity. This method splits it into two
        32-bit integers for easier handling, packing, and unpacking.

        Process:
            1. The timestamp is a 6-byte unsigned integer that we treat as a 64-bit integer
               for ease of use (since Python handles 64-bit integers natively).
            2. We extract the **high 32 bits** (most significant bits) and the **low 32 bits**
               (least significant bits) using bitwise operations.

            - The high 32 bits are extracted by shifting the 64-bit timestamp 32 bits to the right
              (`self.timestamp >> 32`).
            - The low 32 bits are isolated by subtracting the high 32 bits (shifted back to the left)
              from the original 64-bit value (`self.timestamp - (ts1 << 32)`).

        Returns:
            Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing two integers:
                - `ts1`: The high 32 bits (most significant 32 bits)
                - `ts2`: The low 32 bits (least significant 32 bits)

        Example:
            If `self.timestamp = 0x123456789ABC` (in hex, which is 6 bytes long),
            then:
                ts1 = 0x12345678  # high 32 bits

    Creates a new message of a given type with specified attributes.

    This function simplifies the process of message creation by handling
    the instantiation and attribute setting for any valid message type.
    It's particularly useful for simulating trading environments or
    generating test data without manually packing and unpacking bytes.

    Args:
        message_type (bytes):
            A single-byte identifier for the message type (e.g., b'A'
            for AddOrderNoMPIAttributionMessage).
        **kwargs:
            Keyword arguments representing the attributes of the message.
            These must match the attributes expected by the message class
            (e.g., `stock_locate`, `timestamp`, `price`).

    Returns:
        MarketMessage:
            An instance of the corresponding message class, populated with
            the provided attributes.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If the `message_type` is not found in the registered messages.
