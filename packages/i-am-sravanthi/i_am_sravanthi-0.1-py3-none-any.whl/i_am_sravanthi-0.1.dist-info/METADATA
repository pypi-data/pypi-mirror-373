# sravanthi

> A package? Yes. But not just code. This is a tribute â€” to a girl who is more than just logic and syntax.

## About

`sravanthi` is a special Python package that prints a one-line introduction message.  
But beneath that line lies admiration for a girl whoâ€™s known not just for her brilliance,  
but for the spark she brings wherever she goes.

She's famously hyperactive, a storm of laughter and energy â€” the queen of spontaneity.  
Right now, sheâ€™s on her academic journey, pursuing B.Tech at **RGUKT, Nuzvid**.  

This package? Itâ€™s just an excuse to say what code canâ€™t always compile â€”  
_You're extraordinary, Sravanthi._

## Usage

```python
import sravanthi
print(sravanthi)
```
