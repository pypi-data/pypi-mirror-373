# PUCP-Metrix

A comprehensive set of indicators and metrics for assessing text complexity in Spanish, developed by the Artificial Intelligence Group at PUCP (Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Per√∫).

## Overview

PUCP-Metrix is a Python library that provides an extensive collection of text complexity metrics specifically designed for Spanish texts. It implements various linguistic and psycholinguistic measures inspired by Coh-Metrix, adapted and optimized for Spanish language processing.

## Features

### Install the package

```bash
# Using UV (recommended)
uv add iapucp-metrix

# Or using pip
pip install iapucp-metrix
```

### Install Spanish language model

After installing the package, you need to install the required Spanish spaCy model:

```bash
# Using the provided script
./install_es_core_news

# Or manually
uv pip install es_core_news_lg@https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/es_core_news_lg-3.8.0/es_core_news_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Quick Start

```python
from iapucp_metrix.analyzer import Analyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = Analyzer()

# Process multiple texts efficiently
texts = [
    "Primer texto para analizar...",
    "Segundo texto con contenido diferente...",
    "Tercer texto para completar el an√°lisis..."
]

# Compute metrics with multiprocessing
metrics_list = analyzer.compute_metrics(
    texts, 
    workers=4,     # Use 4 CPU cores
    batch_size=2   # Process 2 texts per batch
)

# Process results
for i, metrics in enumerate(metrics_list):
    print(f"Text {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Readability (Fern√°ndez-Huertas): {metrics['RDFHGL']:.2f}")
```

## Development

### Setting up the development environment
