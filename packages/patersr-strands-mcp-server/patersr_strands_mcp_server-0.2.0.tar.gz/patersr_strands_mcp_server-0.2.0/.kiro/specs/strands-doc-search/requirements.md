# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides documentation search capabilities for the Strands Agent SDK. The server will index Strands SDK documentation from GitHub and provide semantic search functionality to help developers find relevant information quickly. This is the foundational feature that will enable future capabilities like project setup and deployment guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Amazon Q Developer or Kiro IDE, I want to search Strands SDK documentation through MCP tools, so that I can quickly find relevant information without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection using the stdio transport protocol
2. WHEN a client requests available tools THEN the server SHALL return a list including documentation search tools
3. WHEN a search query is provided THEN the server SHALL return relevant documentation snippets with source references
4. IF no results are found THEN the server SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the documentation to be automatically indexed and kept reasonably current, so that I always have access to up-to-date information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL be ready for use within 5 seconds using any existing cache
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL perform documentation updates in the background without blocking startup
3. IF documentation download fails THEN the server SHALL use cached documentation and log the failure
4. WHEN indexing completes THEN the server SHALL store the index locally for fast retrieval
5. WHEN no cache exists THEN the server SHALL start with limited functionality and update in the background

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want search results to be semantically relevant and well-formatted, so that I can quickly understand the context and find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search THEN the server SHALL use semantic similarity to rank results
2. WHEN returning results THEN each result SHALL include the document title, relevant snippet, and source URL
3. WHEN multiple results are found THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance score
4. IF a result snippet is too long THEN it SHALL be truncated with clear indication of truncation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer installing the MCP server for the first time, I want it to work immediately without requiring network access, so that I can start using it right away even in offline environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server package is installed THEN it SHALL include a pre-built documentation cache
2. WHEN the server starts for the first time THEN it SHALL use the bundled cache for immediate functionality
3. WHEN a user cache exists THEN it SHALL take precedence over the bundled cache
4. WHEN background updates complete THEN they SHALL update the user cache, not the bundled cache

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to handle errors gracefully and provide clear logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur during documentation download THEN the server SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN invalid search queries are received THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
4. IF the server cannot initialize properly THEN it SHALL exit with a clear error message
