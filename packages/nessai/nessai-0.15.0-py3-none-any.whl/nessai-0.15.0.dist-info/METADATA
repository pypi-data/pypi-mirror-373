# nessai: Nested Sampling with Artificial Intelligence

``nessai`` (/ˈnɛsi/): Nested Sampling with Artificial Intelligence

``nessai`` is a nested sampling algorithm for Bayesian Inference that incorporates normalising flows. It is designed for applications where the Bayesian likelihood is computationally expensive.

## Installation

``nessai`` can be installed using ``pip``:

```console
pip install nessai
```

or via ``conda``

```console
conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch nessai
```

### PyTorch

By default the version of PyTorch will not necessarily match the drivers on your system, to install a different version with the correct CUDA support see the PyTorch homepage for instructions: https://pytorch.org/.

### Using ``bilby``

As of ``bilby`` version 2.3.0, the recommended way to use ``nessai`` is via the [``nessai-bilby`` sampler plugin](https://github.com/bilby-dev/nessai-bilby).
This can be installed via either ``conda`` or ``pip`` and provides the most
up-to-date interface for ``nessai``.
This includes support for the importance nested sampler (``inessai``).

It can be installed using either

```console
pip install nessai-bilby
```

or

```console
conda install -c conda-forge nessai-bilby
```

See the examples included with ``nessai`` for how to run ``nessai`` via ``bilby``.

## Acknowledgements

The core nested sampling code, model design and code for computing the posterior in ``nessai`` was based on [`cpnest`](https://github.com/johnveitch/cpnest) with permission from the authors.

The normalising flows implemented in ``nessai`` are all either directly imported from [`nflows`](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows/tree/master/nflows) or heavily based on it.

Other code snippets that draw on existing code reference the source in their corresponding doc-strings.

The authors also thank Christian Chapman-Bird, Laurence Datrier, Fergus Hayes, Jethro Linley and Simon Tait for their feedback and help finding bugs in ``nessai``.
