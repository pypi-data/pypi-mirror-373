## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Quality

We maintain high code quality standards using automated tools:

#### **Formatting and Linting**
```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/

# Sort imports with isort
isort src/

# Check for issues with flake8
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=127

# Run all checks
black src/ && isort src/ && flake8 src/ --max-line-length=127
```

#### **Code Standards**
- **Line Length**: Maximum 127 characters
- **Import Sorting**: Use isort for consistent import organization
- **Code Formatting**: Use Black for consistent code formatting
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exception types, avoid bare `except`

### Testing

#### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Test CLI functionality
cd src
python main.py --help
python main.py batch --help
python main.py single --help

# Test with sample data
python main.py single ../data/optimize/config/SS-A.csv
```

#### **Algorithm Validation**
When contributing algorithm changes:
- Test with small, medium, and large datasets
- Verify DRR calculations: `DRR = 1 - (I/R)`
- Check that intrinsic dimensions are reasonable (I ‚â§ R)
- Validate against known dataset characteristics

### Documentation

#### **Code Documentation**
- Use clear, descriptive docstrings for all public functions
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Provide usage examples in docstrings
- Document any algorithmic assumptions or limitations

#### **README Updates**
When adding features, update relevant sections:
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Installation instructions
- Command-line options

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. **Before Starting Development**
```bash
# Ensure you're on main and sync with upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
```

### 2. **During Development**
```bash
# Make your changes, then run quality checks
black src/
isort src/
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=127

# Test your changes
cd src
python main.py --help  # Basic functionality test
```

### 3. **Before Committing**
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -s -m "Add feature: descriptive summary

Detailed description of what was changed and why.
Fixes #issue-number (if applicable)"
```

### 4. **Submitting Changes**
```bash
# Push your feature branch to your fork
git push origin feature/descriptive-name

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# 1. Go to your fork on GitHub
# 2. Click "Compare & pull request" button
# 3. Ensure the base repository is andre-motta/dimensionality_reduction_ratio
# 4. Ensure the base branch is "main"
# 5. Provide clear title and description
# 6. Reference any related issues
# 7. Include testing notes
```

#### **Pull Request Guidelines**
- **Title**: Use clear, descriptive titles (e.g., "Add cosine distance metric support")
- **Description**: Include:
  - What changes were made and why
  - How to test the changes
  - Any breaking changes or migration notes
  - Screenshots/examples if relevant
- **References**: Link related issues using `Fixes #123` or `Addresses #456`
- **Ready for Review**: Mark as draft if still in progress

### 5. **Keeping Your Fork Updated**
```bash
# Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# If you need to update a feature branch with latest changes
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main  # or: git merge main
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force-with-lease  # if rebased
```

#### **Handling Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# If there are conflicts during rebase/merge
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add resolved-file.py
git rebase --continue  # if rebasing
# or git commit  # if merging
```
# - Reference any related issues
# - Include testing notes
```
