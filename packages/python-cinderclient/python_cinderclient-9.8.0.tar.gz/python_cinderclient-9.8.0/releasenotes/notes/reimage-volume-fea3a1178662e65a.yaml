    A new ``cinder reimage`` command and related python API binding has been
    added which allows a user to replace the current content of a specified
    volume with the data of a specified image supplied by the Image service
    (Glance).  (Note that this is a destructive action, that is, all data
    currently contained in the volume is destroyed when the volume is
    re-imaged.)  This feature requires Block Storage API microversion 3.68
    or greater.
