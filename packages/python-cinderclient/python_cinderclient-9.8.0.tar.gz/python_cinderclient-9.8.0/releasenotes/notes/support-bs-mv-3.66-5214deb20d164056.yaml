    Adds support for Block Storage API version 3.66, which drops the
    requirement of a 'force' flag to create a snapshot of an in-use
    volume.  Although the 'force' flag is invalid for the ``snapshot-create``
    call for API versions 3.66 and higher, for backward compatibility the
    cinderclient follows the Block Storage API in silently ignoring the
    flag when it is passed with a value that evaluates to True.
