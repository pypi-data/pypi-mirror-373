prelude: |
    The Xena release of the python-cinderclient supports Block Storage
    API version 3 through microversion 3.66.  (The maximum microversion
    of the Block Storage API in the Xena release is 3.66.)
upgrade:
  - |
    The python-cinderclient no longer supports version 2 of the Block
    Storage API.  The last version of the python-cinderclient supporting
    that API is the 7.x series.
features:
  - |
    Supports Block Storage API version 3.65, which displays a boolean
    ``consumes_quota`` field on volume and snapshot detail responses
    and which allows filtering volume and snapshot list responses using
    the standard ``--filters [<key=value> [<key=value> ...]]`` option
    to the ``cinder list`` or ``cinder snapshot-list`` commands.

    Filtering by this field may not always be possible in a cloud.
    Use the ``cinder list-filters`` command to see what filters are
    available in the cloud you are using.
