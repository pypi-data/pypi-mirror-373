    The configuration class is expected to be a [`dataclasses.dataclass`][], which is
    used to create a [`marshmallow.Schema`][] schema to validate the configuration
    dictionary using [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][] (which in turn uses the
    [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][] method to do the validation and deserialization).

    To customize the schema derived from the configuration dataclass, you can use the
    `metadata` key in [`dataclasses.field`][] to pass extra options to
    [`marshmallow_dataclass`][] to be used during validation and deserialization.

    Additional arguments can be passed to [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][] using keyword
    arguments `marshmallow_load_kwargs`.

    Note:
        This method will raise [`marshmallow.ValidationError`][] if the configuration
        dictionary is invalid and you have to have in mind all of the gotchas of
        [`marshmallow`][] and [`marshmallow_dataclass`][] applies when using this
        function.  It is recommended to carefully read the documentation of these
        libraries.

    Args:
        cls: The configuration class.
        config: The configuration dictionary.
        base_schema: An optional class to be used as a base schema for the configuration
            class. This allow using custom fields for example. Will be passed to
            [`marshmallow_dataclass.class_schema`][].
        marshmallow_load_kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to
            [`marshmallow.Schema.load`][].
