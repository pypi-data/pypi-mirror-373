    This timer uses the wall clock to trigger ticks and handles discrepancies between
    the wall clock and monotonic time. Since sleeping is performed using monotonic time,
    differences between the two clocks can occur.

    When the wall clock progresses slower than monotonic time, it is referred to as
    *compression* (wall clock time appears in the past relative to monotonic time).
    Conversely, when the wall clock progresses faster, it is called *expansion*
    (wall clock time appears in the future relative to monotonic time). If these
    differences exceed a configured threshold, a warning is emitted. The threshold
    is defined by the
    [`wall_clock_drift_tolerance_factor`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.WallClockTimerConfig.wall_clock_drift_tolerance_factor].

    If the difference becomes excessively large, it is treated as a *time jump*.
    Time jumps can occur, for example, when the wall clock is adjusted by NTP after
    being out of sync for an extended period. In such cases, the timer resynchronizes
    with the wall clock and triggers an immediate tick. The threshold for detecting
    time jumps is controlled by the
    [`wall_clock_jump_threshold`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.WallClockTimerConfig.wall_clock_jump_threshold].

    The timer ensures ticks are aligned to the
    [`align_to`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.WallClockTimerConfig.align_to] configuration,
    even after time jumps.

    Additionally, the timer emits warnings if the actual sleep duration deviates
    significantly from the requested duration. This can happen due to event loop
    blocking or system overload. The tolerance for such deviations is defined by the
    [`async_drift_tolerance`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.WallClockTimerConfig.async_drift_tolerance].

    To account for these complexities, each tick provides a
    [`TickInfo`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.TickInfo] object, which includes detailed
