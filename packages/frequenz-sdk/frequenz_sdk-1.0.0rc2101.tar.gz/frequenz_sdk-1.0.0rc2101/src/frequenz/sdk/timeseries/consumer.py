class Consumer:
    """Calculate high level consumer metrics in a microgrid.

    Under normal circumstances this is expected to correspond to the gross
    consumption of the site excluding active parts and battery.

    Consumer provides methods for fetching power values from different points
    in the microgrid. These methods return `FormulaReceiver` objects, which can
    be used like normal `Receiver`s, but can also be composed to form
    higher-order formula streams.

    !!! note
        `Consumer` instances are not meant to be created directly by users.
        Use the [`microgrid.consumer`][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.consumer] method
        for creating `Consumer` instances.

    Example:
        ```python
        from datetime import timedelta

        from frequenz.sdk import microgrid
        from frequenz.sdk.timeseries import ResamplerConfig2

        await microgrid.initialize(
            "grpc://127.0.0.1:50051",
            ResamplerConfig2(resampling_period=timedelta(seconds=1.0))
        )

        consumer = microgrid.consumer()

        # Get a receiver for a builtin formula
        consumer_power_recv = consumer.power.new_receiver()
        async for consumer_power_sample in consumer_power_recv:
