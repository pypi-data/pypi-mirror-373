"""Defines a graph representation of how microgrid components are connected.

The component graph is an approximate representation of the microgrid circuit,
abstracted to a level appropriate for higher-level monitoring and control.
Common use cases include:

* Combining component measurements to compute grid power or onsite load by using
  the graph structure to determine which measurements to aggregate

* Identifying which inverter(s) need to be engaged to charge or discharge
  a particular battery based on their connectivity in the graph

* Understanding which power flows in the microgrid are derived from green vs
  grey sources based on the component connectivity

The graph deliberately does not include all pieces of hardware placed in the microgrid,
instead limiting itself to just those that are needed to monitor and control the
flow of power.
