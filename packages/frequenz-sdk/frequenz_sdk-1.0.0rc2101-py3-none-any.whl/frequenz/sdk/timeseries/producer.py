class Producer:
    """Calculate high level producer metrics in a microgrid.

    Under normal circumstances this is expected to correspond to the gross
    production of the sites active parts excluding EV chargers and batteries.

    Producer provides methods for fetching power values from different points
    in the microgrid. These methods return `FormulaReceiver` objects, which can
    be used like normal `Receiver`s, but can also be composed to form
    higher-order formula streams.

    !!! note
        `Producer` instances are not meant to be created directly by users.
        Use the [`microgrid.producer`][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.producer] method
        for creating `Producer` instances.

    Example:
        ```python
        from datetime import timedelta

        from frequenz.sdk import microgrid
        from frequenz.sdk.timeseries import ResamplerConfig2

        await microgrid.initialize(
            "grpc://127.0.0.1:50051",
            ResamplerConfig2(resampling_period=timedelta(seconds=1.0))
        )

        producer = microgrid.producer()

        # Get a receiver for a builtin formula
        producer_power_recv = producer.power.new_receiver()
        async for producer_power_sample in producer_power_recv:
