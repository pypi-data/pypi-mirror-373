Crust is an interactive Linux shell written in Python, designed with a modern interface, AI integration, and enhanced tooling for common system tasks.

**Note:** I am currecntly putting crust into package managers, but it is not ready yet. Until there is an announcment, any packages made by me that are crust are not ready. Please use the `pip install .` way in the Documentation section.
