"""
This file will help to demonstrate pipeline for testing microscopy data using the DeepCAD-RT algorithm.
The demo shows how to construct the params and call the relevant functions for testing DeepCAD-RT network.
The demo will automatically download tif file and corresponding model file for demo testing.
See inside for details.

* This demo is also available as a jupyter notebook (see demo_test_pipeline.ipynb) and Colab notebook (see
DeepCAD_RT_demo_colab.ipynb)

More information can be found in the companion paper.
