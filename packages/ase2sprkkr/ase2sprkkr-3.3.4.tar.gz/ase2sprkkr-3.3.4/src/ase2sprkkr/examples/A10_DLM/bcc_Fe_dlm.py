# Script demonstrating how to set up a disordered local moment (DLM) calculation
# using bcc Fe as the test case.
#
# Such calculations are used to describe the paramagnetic state of materials,
# where local magnetic moments on atoms persist, but where the net magnetisation
# of the material is zero on account of thermally induced spin fluctuations. The 
# CPA is used to average over possible orientations of magnetic moment. Above the Curie
# temperature, all orientations of magnetic moment are equally probably, and the
# probability distribution of orientations of magnetic moments is uniform on the sphere. 
# In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the CPA condition for a full average (using 
# an angular integral) over the sphere with uniform probability distribution can be shown 
# to be mathematically equivalent to the CPA condition for a 50:50 Ising 'alloy' of 'up' 
# and 'down' magnetic moments. (Note that this equality does not strictly hold in the 
# case where spin-orbit effects are present, as in a fully relativistic calculation.)
#
# A DLM calculation should be iterated to self-consistency to check whether the local
# moments 'collapse' (as frequently happens for elements like Cr, Ni) or whether they
# are self-sustaining (as is typical for Fe, Co).
#
# Once you have run this script and iterated to self-consistency, if you run
# `tail Fe.pot_new`
# you should find that, although the net magnetisation of the calculation is zero,
# the two Fe atoms have equal and opposite magnetic moments, each of magnitude
# approximately 2.16 \mu_B. This confirms that the local moments are self-sustaining,
# and that bcc Fe is a 'good' local moment system.
#
