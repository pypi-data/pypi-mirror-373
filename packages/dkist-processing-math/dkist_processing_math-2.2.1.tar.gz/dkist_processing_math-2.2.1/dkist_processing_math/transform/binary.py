    """Generate a binary image from an input float or int array.

    A threshold value is chosen via Otsu's method and all values below the threshold are set to 1 while everything
    else is set to 0. Thus the result is technically an _inverse_ binary image, which is useful for isolating the
    target grid as a feature of interest.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        Data to convert to binary

    numotsu
        The number of times to perform thresholding using Otsu's method. Numbers larger than 1 are useful if the
        pixel distribution of the data has > 2 modes.

    Returns
    -------
    An array of 1's and 0's corresponding to the thresholded input data.
