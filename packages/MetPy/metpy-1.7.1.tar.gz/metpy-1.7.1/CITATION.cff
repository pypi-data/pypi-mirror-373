abstract: >
    MetPy is an open-source and community-driven Python package for meteorology designed to fit well within the scientific Python stack (numpy, matplotlib, etc.).
    Its goal is to bring the scripted weather analysis capabilities of GEMPAK (and tools like it) to the powerful scientific Python ecosystem.
    The guiding principle is to make MetPy easy to use with any dataset that can be read into Python.
    MetPy's general functionality breaks down into reading data, meteorological calculations, and meteorology-specific plotting.
