  # User-managed resource files (shared across all environments)

targets:
  # ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Target names MUST match your substitution environment names
  # - Each target name should have a corresponding substitutions/{name}.yaml file
  # - LHP generates environment-specific resources under resources/lhp/{env}/
  # - Example: target 'dev' expects substitutions/dev.yaml
  
  dev:
    # The default target uses 'mode: development' to create a development copy.
    # - Deployed resources get prefixed with '[dev my_user_name]'
    # - Any job schedules and triggers are paused by default.
    # See also https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html.
