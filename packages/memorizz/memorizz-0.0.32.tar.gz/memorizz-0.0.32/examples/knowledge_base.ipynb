Founded in 1952 and headquartered in California, Acme has established itself (in the realms of cartoons and fiction) as a leading supplier of creative and often humorous devices. With about 5,000 employees worldwide, the company is recognized for popular products such as the Portable Hole, Rocket Skates, and the Giant Rubber Band.\n",

      "Acme’s products are famously featured in classic animation—particularly the Looney Tunes series—where they are frequently used (and misused) by characters like Wile E. Coyote. Over more than 70 years, Acme has become synonymous with imaginative—and sometimes unpredictable—gadgets that capture the spirit of invention.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the Portable Hole?\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Portable Hole is a fictional, highly versatile device that creates a temporary passage through any solid surface—such as walls, floors, or ceilings. \n",
      "- To use it, simply unfold the Portable Hole and place it on the surface you wish to pass through. Instantly, the spot becomes a usable, traversable hole, allowing you to move to the other side as if the surface didn’t exist.\n",
      "- When you’re done, remove the Portable Hole. It can be folded up for easy storage and carried in your pocket or bag for quick access.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special Notes and Warnings:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Portable Hole is reusable and designed for convenience, but should be handled with care.\n",
      "- Important safety warning: Do not stack multiple Portable Holes or place them face-to-face. Doing so may cause unpredictable effects, including the potential to create a rift in space-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Origin & Popularity:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Portable Hole first rose to fame in Looney Tunes cartoons, especially in the escapades of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Its imaginative, reality-bending function captures the playful, inventive spirit for which Acme Corporation is known.\n",
