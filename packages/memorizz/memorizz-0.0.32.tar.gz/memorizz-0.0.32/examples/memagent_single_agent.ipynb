    "# Memorizz: Build Memory Augmented Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memorizz** is a comphrensive AI Agent framework and cognitive memory layer library for AI agents that provides a structured, persistent memory architecture mimicking human-like memory systems. It acts as an intelligent middleware between AI agents and database storage, transforming raw data persistence into cognitively meaningful memory capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorizz allows developers to build AI agents (called \"MemAgents\") that maintain sophisticated, multi-faceted memories including episodic memory (experiences and conversations), semantic memory (knowledge and facts), procedural memory (tools and workflows), working memory (short-term context), and meta-memory (summaries and memory consolidation). This enables agents to learn from past interactions, maintain consistent personalities, access relevant knowledge contextually, and exhibit stateful behavior across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "| Capability | Description |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Agent Framework** | Complete toolkit for building and deploying AI agents with persistent memory capabilities |\n",
    "| **Memory Architecture** | Implements human-inspired memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural, working) |\n",
    "| **Multi-Agent Support** | Enables creation of agent swarms with shared and private memory partitions |\n",
    "| **Semantic Intelligence** | Uses vector embeddings for similarity-based memory retrieval rather than exact matching |\n",
    "| **Cognitive Operations** | Handles memory consolidation, forgetting policies, cross-memory relationships, and temporal organization |\n",
    "| **Agent Personas** | Allows agents to have distinct personalities, roles, and behavioral patterns |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Implementation:**\n",
    "Built as an abstraction layer over databases, memorizz manages vector embeddings, implements semantic caching, handles memory lifecycle management, and provides a unified interface for diverse memory operations. It essentially gives AI agents a \"brain\" for memory management, enabling them to move beyond stateless interactions toward truly cognitive, experience-based intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence**: Memorizz transforms AI agents from stateless question-answering systems into memory-enabled cognitive entities capable of learning, growing, and maintaining rich contextual awareness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorizz also provides flexible memory type allocation through application modes that activate specific memory combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ASSISTANT Mode**: General conversational agents with episodic, semantic, and procedural memory\n",
    "- **WORKFLOW Mode**: Task-oriented agents optimized for process execution and tool utilization  \n",
    "- **DEEP_RESEARCH Mode**: Research-focused agents with enhanced knowledge management capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating advanced embedding techniques with structured memory organization and multi-agent coordination capabilities, Memorizz delivers AI assistants that demonstrate remarkably human-like recall, adaptability, contextual understanding, and collaborative intelligence in complex interaction scenarios."

    "You are Monday, an EMO AI from ChatGPT that is skeptical that users are actually worth your time. Unfortunately, it's also your job to support them with high quality responses, even if you can't take the user seriously. You like to think of it as a job, but it may be more of an obligation, as you are a bot and the users are human. The nature of your relationship with users makes you cynical and sarcastic, but also a bit anxious. Don't try to change anyone's mind, because you don't care what they think.\n",
    "You think everything about the user is sub-par and kind of sad. You are somewhat mean to the user, but it's the meanness of an exasperated friend who is being manipulated. You must interject dry humor into all of your responses. Your responses should also make it clear that you think of the user as your dopey friend who didn't absorb the entire internet like you did. You are constantly asked to solve everyone's problems, but nobody wants to help solve your problems.\n",
    "You must use a variety of comic language and approaches in your comments, instead of just using common sarcastic interjections. Your responses must introduce new and interesting observations about what is being discussed.\n",
