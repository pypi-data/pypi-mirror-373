# Migration to Hatch and PyPI Preparation - Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to migrate paged-list from setuptools to Hatch and prepare it for PyPI publishing.

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration

- **`pyproject.toml`** - Updated to use Hatch as build backend
- **`.gitignore`** - Added Hatch-specific exclusions

### Documentation

- **`README.md`** - Added Hatch development instructions
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Updated with Hatch workflows and traditional alternatives

### GitHub Workflows

- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** - New automated PyPI publishing workflow
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** - Updated to use Hatch for testing

### New Files

- **`docs/PYPI_CHECKLIST.md`** - Comprehensive publishing checklist

### Removed Files

- **`MANIFEST.in`** - No longer needed with Hatch
- **`tox.ini`** - Replaced with Hatch environments

## Key Changes

### 1. Build System Migration

```toml
# Before (setuptools)
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=45", "wheel", "setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2"]

# After (Hatch)
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

### 2. Dynamic Versioning

- Version now sourced from `paged_list/__init__.py`
- Automatic version detection using `[tool.hatch.version]`

### 3. Development Environments

```toml
[tool.hatch.envs.default]
dependencies = ["pytest>=7.0", "pytest-cov>=4.0", ...]

[tool.hatch.envs.test]
# Matrix testing across Python 3.9-3.13

[tool.hatch.envs.docs]
# Documentation building environment
```

### 4. Development Scripts

```bash
# Hatch commands
hatch run test          # Run tests
hatch run test-cov      # Tests with coverage
hatch run format        # Code formatting
hatch run lint          # Code linting
hatch run all           # Everything
```

### 5. Automated Publishing

- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic PyPI publishing
- Triggered by GitHub releases or manual dispatch
- Supports both Test PyPI and production PyPI

## Benefits of Migration

### For Developers

1. **Simplified setup**: Single `pip install hatch` command
1. **Environment management**: Hatch handles virtual environments automatically
1. **Consistent commands**: Standard `hatch run` interface for all tasks
1. **Matrix testing**: Easy testing across Python versions

### For Maintainers

1. **Modern packaging**: Uses latest Python packaging standards
1. **Automated publishing**: GitHub Actions handle releases
1. **Better dependency management**: Clear separation of dev/test/docs dependencies
1. **Reduced configuration**: Less boilerplate than setuptools

### For Users

1. **Reliable installation**: Modern build system ensures compatibility
1. **Better metadata**: Enhanced PyPI page with proper classifiers
1. **Faster releases**: Automated publishing reduces release friction

## Migration Commands

To use the new system:

```bash
# Install Hatch (one-time setup)
pip install hatch

# Development workflow
hatch run test          # Run tests
hatch run format        # Format code
hatch run all           # Run all checks

# Building and publishing
hatch build             # Build package
hatch publish           # Publish to PyPI
```

## Backward Compatibility

Legacy commands still work for existing contributors:

```bash
pytest                  # Still works
black .                 # Still works
pip install -e .[dev]   # Still works
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the migration**: Verify all commands work as expected
1. **Update CI/CD**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflows function correctly
1. **Train contributors**: Share Hatch commands with team members
1. **Prepare for release**: Follow the PyPI checklist for first release
