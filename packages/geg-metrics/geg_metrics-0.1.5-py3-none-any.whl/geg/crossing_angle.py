def crossing_angle(G: nx.Graph, ideal_angle: float = 90, crossings: Optional[List[Tuple[Any, float]]] = None) -> float:
    """
    Compute a crossing-angle quality score relative to an ideal angle.

    If crossings are not provided, they are computed. For each edge crossing,
    the crossing angle (in degrees) is compared to the ideal (default 90).
    The metric aggregates the normalized shortfall (ideal - angle)/ideal across
    all crossings and returns 1 minus the average shortfall.

    Notes:
        - If there are no crossings, returns 1.0.
        - Crossing angles are assumed to be the acute angles in [0, 90].

    Args:
        G: A NetworkX graph with edge paths.
        ideal_angle: The desired crossing angle in degrees (default 90).
        crossings: Optional list of crossings as tuples where the second element
            is the crossing angle in degrees. If None, crossings are computed.

    Returns:
        A float in [0, 1], with higher values indicating better crossing angles.
