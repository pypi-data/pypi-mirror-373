    """
    Neighbourhood preservation score via Jaccard similarity in [0, 1].

    Compares topological adjacency to geometric k-nearest neighbours. Builds a
    boolean adjacency matrix A from the graph and a boolean matrix K where
    K[i, j] is True if j is among the k closest nodes to i in the layout.
    Returns J(A, K) = |A <intersection> K| / |A <union> K|.

    Args:
        G: A NetworkX graph with node coordinates 'x' and 'y'.
        k: Number of geometric neighbours to consider; if None, uses
           floor(average degree).

    Returns:
        A float in [0, 1], where higher means better preservation of
        neighbourhoods.
