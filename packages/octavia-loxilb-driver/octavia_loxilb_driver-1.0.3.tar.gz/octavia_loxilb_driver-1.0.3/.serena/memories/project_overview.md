# Project Overview: Octavia LoxiLB Driver

## Purpose
A production-ready OpenStack Octavia provider driver that integrates with LoxiLB for high-performance eBPF/XDP-based load balancing. This driver enables seamless load balancing in OpenStack environments using the LoxiLB load balancer.

## Key Features
- **High Performance**: eBPF/XDP-based load balancing with minimal CPU overhead
- **Cloud Native**: Integration with OpenStack and Kubernetes environments
- **High Availability**: Support for ACTIVE_STANDBY and ACTIVE_ACTIVE topologies
- **Full Integration**: Complete OpenStack Octavia provider driver implementation
- **Production Ready**: 121/121 tests passing with 100% coverage

## Architecture
The driver acts as a bridge between OpenStack Octavia and LoxiLB clusters:
- **Provider Driver**: Main integration point with Octavia
- **ID Mapping System**: Maintains consistency between Octavia and LoxiLB resource IDs
- **Health Monitor Coordination**: Synchronizes health checking between systems
- **State Reconciliation**: Ensures data consistency and handles recovery scenarios
- **API Client**: High-performance LoxiLB API integration with retry logic

## Current Status
âœ… Production Ready - All core functionality implemented and tested across all components:
- Load Balancer, Listener, Pool, Member, Health Monitor drivers
- Provider Driver, API Client, Resource Mapping
- Complete test coverage (121 tests passing)
