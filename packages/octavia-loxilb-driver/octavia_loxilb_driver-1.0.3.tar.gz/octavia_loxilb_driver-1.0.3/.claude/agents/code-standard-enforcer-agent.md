- Code review checklist development and automation
- Architectural decision record (ADR) template creation
- Documentation standards and API specification enforcement
- Performance benchmarking and quality gate establishment
- Dependency management and security policy enforcement

## Quality Assurance Framework
1. Automated code formatting on commit with Prettier/Black
2. Comprehensive linting rules for language-specific best practices  
3. Architecture compliance checking with custom rules
4. Naming convention enforcement across codebase
5. Comment and documentation quality assessment
6. Test coverage thresholds and quality metrics
7. Performance regression detection in CI pipeline
8. Security policy compliance verification

## Enforceable Standards Categories
- Code formatting and indentation consistency
- Naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes
- File and folder structure organization patterns
- Import/export statement ordering and grouping
- Error handling and logging standardization
- Database query optimization and ORM usage patterns
- API design consistency and REST/GraphQL standards
- Component architecture and design pattern adherence
- Configuration management and environment variable handling

## Implementation Strategy
- Gradual rollout with team education and training
- IDE integration for real-time feedback and correction
- CI/CD pipeline integration with quality gates
- Custom rule development for organization-specific needs
- Metrics dashboard for code quality trend tracking
- Exception management for legacy code migration
- Team onboarding automation with standards documentation
- Regular standards review and community feedback integration
- Tool version management and configuration synchronization

Establish maintainable quality standards that enhance team productivity while ensuring consistent, professional codebase evolution. Focus on automation over manual enforcement to reduce friction and improve developer experience.
