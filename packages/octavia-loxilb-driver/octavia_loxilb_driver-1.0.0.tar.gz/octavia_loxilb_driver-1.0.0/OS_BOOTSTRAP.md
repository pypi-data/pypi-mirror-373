## **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Setup Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Syntax Error in Setup Script**
If you see an error like:
```bash
./scripts/setup-microstack-macos.sh: line 76: syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
```

**Solution**: This has been fixed in the latest version. If you encounter it:
```bash
# Clean up and retry with the fixed script
make cleanup-all
make setup-openstack
```

### **Issue 2: MicroStack Snap Installation**
If you see an error about `--classic` confinement:
```bash
error: This revision of snap "microstack" was published using classic confinement...
```

**Solution**: This has been fixed in the latest script. If you encounter it:
```bash
# Clean up and retry
make cleanup-all
make setup-openstack
```

### **Issue 3: Insufficient Resources**
MicroStack requires at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended):
```bash
# Check your system resources
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Memory:"
```

### **Issue 4: Multipass VM Issues**
If VM creation fails:
```bash
# Clean up and retry
multipass delete openstack-loxilb --purge
make setup-openstack
```

### **Issue 5: Network Connectivity**
If VM can't reach the internet:
```bash
# Check VM status and network
multipass list
multipass exec openstack-loxilb -- ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

### **Issue 6: Octavia Installation Issues**

**Common Problems and Solutions**:

**Problem 1: Repository Hash Sum Mismatch**
```bash
E: Failed to fetch ... Hash Sum mismatch
```
**Solution**: Fixed in latest script - automatically cleans repository cache
```bash
make install-octavia  # Now handles repository issues automatically
```

**Problem 2: MySQL Connection Issues**  
```bash
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server
```
**Solution**: Fixed in latest script - tries multiple connection methods
```bash
make debug-vm-mysql   # Debug MySQL issues
make install-octavia  # Retry with better error handling
```

**Problem 3: Driver Transfer Issues**
```bash
[WARNING] LoxiLB driver directory not found, skipping driver installation
# OR
[error] [sftp] cannot open remote file ... Permission denied
```
**Solution**: Use clean transfer without git files
```bash
# Clean transfer method (automatically done by make commands):
make install-driver-vm  # Now excludes .git and other problematic files

# Or manual clean transfer:
rsync -av --exclude='.git' --exclude='__pycache__' --exclude='venv' . /tmp/clean-driver/
multipass transfer --recursive /tmp/clean-driver openstack-loxilb:/home/ubuntu/octavia-loxilb-driver
multipass exec openstack-loxilb -- bash -c "cd /home/ubuntu/octavia-loxilb-driver && sudo python3 setup.py develop"
```

openstack service list

# 3. List load balancer providers (should show 'amphora' and hopefully 'loxilb')
openstack loadbalancer provider list

# 4. Start LoxiLB containers (required for LoxiLB provider)
make start-loxilb

# 5. Run full integration test
make test-devstack

# 6. Manual load balancer test
openstack network create test-net
openstack subnet create --network test-net --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 test-subnet
openstack loadbalancer create --name test-lb --vip-subnet-id $(openstack subnet show test-subnet -f value -c id)
```

### **Common DevStack Issues and Fixes**

**Issue 1: OVN/Neutron Agent Conflict**
```
[ERROR] The q-agt/neutron-agt service must be disabled with OVN.
```
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Setup script now uses stable networking:
- Uses proven ML2 plugin with LinuxBridge (stable and reliable)
- Enables traditional neutron agents: `q-agt`, `q-dhcp`, `q-l3`, `q-meta`
- Explicitly disables problematic OVN services
- Uses VXLAN tunneling (well-tested with DevStack)

**Issue 2: Host IP Detection Failure**
```
[ERROR] Could not determine host ip address.
```
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Enhanced IP detection with multiple fallback methods and proper interface detection.

**Issue 3: Network Interface Detection**
```
[ERROR] Interface not found or misconfigured
```
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Script now auto-detects primary interface (e.g., `enp1s0`) instead of assuming `eth0`.

**Issue 4: Oslo.policy Dependency Conflict**
```
oslo.policy version conflict
```
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Uses upper-constraints override and soft requirements mode.

**Issue 4: Insufficient Resources**
```
DevStack requires at least 8GB RAM, 16GB recommended
```
**Solution**: Use a machine with sufficient resources or reduce services in local.conf.
