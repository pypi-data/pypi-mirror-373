              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# MorphCards

**Spaced Spatial Repetition (SSR) software with AI-generated sentence variations for language learning.**

[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/morphcards.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/morphcards)

For developer documentation (including containerization and contributing), see [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md).

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional SSR software often repeats the exact same sentence cards, leading users to memorize the front of cards rather than truly learning the language. MorphCards solves this by generating new, contextually appropriate sentences each time a card is reviewed, ensuring learners can identify and understand words in different contexts.

## ✨ Features

- **FSRS-based Spaced Repetition**: Uses the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler for optimal learning intervals
- **AI-Generated Sentence Variations**: Creates new sentences using OpenAI or Google Gemini APIs
- **Vocabulary-Aware Generation**: Ensures new sentences only use previously learned vocabulary
- **In-Memory Database**: Fast DuckDB-based storage for cards and review history
- **Parameter Optimization**: Automatically optimizes FSRS parameters based on your learning patterns
- **Multiple AI Services**: Support for both OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for daily use
- **Web Demo**: Interactive Gradio interface for testing and demonstration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install morphcards

# Install with demo dependencies
pip install morphcards[demo]
```

### Environment Variables

**This documentation assumes Gemini is being used by default.** All examples assume you have a `.env` file with your API keys.

**Create a `.env` file in your project root:**
```bash
# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.5-flash # Example: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash

#OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here  # Uncomment for OpenAI
#OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo # Example: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from morphcards import Card, Scheduler, VocabularyDatabase
from morphcards.ai import AIServiceFactory
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize components
db = VocabularyDatabase()
scheduler = Scheduler()
ai_service = AIServiceFactory.create_service("gemini", model_name="gemini-2.5-flash") # Example with model_name

# Create a card
card = Card(
    id="hello_1",
    word="hello",
    sentence="Hello, how are you?",
    original_sentence="Hello, how are you?",
    due_date=datetime.now()
)

# Add to database
db.add_card(card)

# Review the card
updated_card, review_log = scheduler.review_card(
    card=card,
    rating=3,  # Good
    now=datetime.now(),
    ai_api_key="your-api-key",
    vocabulary_database=db,
    ai_service=ai_service
)

print(f"New sentence: {updated_card.sentence}")
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Add a new card
morphcards add "bonjour" "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?" --language French

# Review due cards (uses .env file)
morphcards review --ai-service gemini --model-name gemini-2.5-flash

# Show statistics
morphcards stats

# Optimize parameters
morphcards optimize
```

## 📊 Demo Interface

Start the interactive demo:

```bash
# Run demo locally (after installing with [demo] extras)
morphcards demo
```

The demo provides:
- **Add Cards**: Create new learning cards
- **Review Cards**: Interactive review process with AI sentence generation
- **Statistics**: View learning progress and vocabulary stats
- **Optimization**: Optimize FSRS parameters

## 🏗️ Architecture

For detailed architecture diagrams and system design, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

### Core Components
