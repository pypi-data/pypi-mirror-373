           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# MorphCards

**Spaced Spatial Repetition (SSR) software with AI-generated sentence variations for language learning.**

[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/morphcards.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/morphcards)

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional SSR software often repeats the exact same sentence cards, leading users to memorize the front of cards rather than truly learning the language. MorphCards solves this by generating new, contextually appropriate sentences each time a card is reviewed, ensuring learners can identify and understand words in different contexts.

## 📚 Documentation

- **[Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)** - System design, data flow, and component diagrams
- **[API Reference](#-api-reference)** - Detailed class and method documentation
- **[Examples](#-examples)** - Usage examples and tutorials

## 🔑 Environment Variables

**This documentation assumes Gemini is being used by default.** All examples assume you have a `.env` file with your API keys.

**Create a `.env` file in your project root:**
```bash
# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.5-flash # Example: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here  # Uncomment for OpenAI
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo # Example: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo
```

**For OpenAI users**: Replace `GEMINI_API_KEY` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

## ✨ Features

- **FSRS-based Spaced Repetition**: Uses the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler for optimal learning intervals
- **AI-Generated Sentence Variations**: Creates new sentences using OpenAI or Google Gemini APIs
- **Vocabulary-Aware Generation**: Ensures new sentences only use previously learned vocabulary
- **In-Memory Database**: Fast DuckDB-based storage for cards and review history
- **Parameter Optimization**: Automatically optimizes FSRS parameters based on your learning patterns
- **Multiple AI Services**: Support for both OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for daily use
- **Web Demo**: Interactive Gradio interface for testing and demonstration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install morphcards

# Install with demo dependencies
pip install morphcards[demo]

# Install with development dependencies
pip install morphcards[dev]
```

### 🎯 Quick Demo (One Command)

```bash
# Run demo immediately with Podman
podman run --rm -p 7860:7860 \
  --env-file .env \
  docker.io/library/python:3.11-slim \
  bash -c "pip install morphcards[demo] && python -m morphcards.demo"
```

Then open http://localhost:7860 in your browser!

**Note**: The first run may take a few minutes as it downloads and installs dependencies.

**Environment Variables**: This documentation assumes Gemini is being used. For OpenAI users, replace `GEMINI_API_KEY` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` in all commands.

**Pro Tip**: Use `make all` to run everything at once! See the [Makefile section](#-quick-start-with-makefile) for details.

### Container Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Using Podman (recommended)
podman build -t morphcards .
podman run -p 7860:7860 morphcards

# One-shot demo with Podman (no build required)
podman run --rm -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env docker.io/library/python:3.11-slim bash -c "
  pip install morphcards[demo] &&
  python -m morphcards.demo
"

# Using Docker
docker build -t morphcards .
docker run -p 7860:7860 morphcards
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from morphcards import Card, Scheduler, VocabularyDatabase
from morphcards.ai import AIServiceFactory
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize components
db = VocabularyDatabase()
scheduler = Scheduler()
ai_service = AIServiceFactory.create_service("openai", model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo") # Example with model_name

# Create a card
card = Card(
    id="hello_1",
    word="hello",
    sentence="Hello, how are you?",
    original_sentence="Hello, how are you?",
    due_date=datetime.now()
)

# Add to database
db.add_card(card)

# Review the card
updated_card, review_log = scheduler.review_card(
    card=card,
    rating=3,  # Good
    now=datetime.now(),
    ai_api_key="your-api-key",
    vocabulary_database=db,
    ai_service=ai_service
)

print(f"New sentence: {updated_card.sentence}")
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Add a new card
morphcards add "bonjour" "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?" --language French

# Review due cards (uses .env file)
morphcards review --ai-service gemini --model-name gemini-2.5-flash

# Show statistics
morphcards stats

# Optimize parameters
morphcards optimize
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

For detailed architecture diagrams and system design, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

### Core Components

- **`Card`**: Represents a flashcard with word, sentence, and FSRS parameters
- **`Scheduler`**: Manages spaced repetition scheduling using FSRS algorithm
- **`Optimizer`**: Optimizes FSRS parameters based on review history
- **`VocabularyDatabase`**: Stores cards, reviews, and vocabulary using DuckDB
- **`AIService`**: Abstract interface for AI sentence generation
- **`OpenAIService`**: OpenAI API integration
- **`GeminiService`**: Google Gemini API integration

### Data Flow

1. **Card Creation**: User creates a card with word and sentence
2. **Review Process**: User reviews card and rates their recall
3. **AI Generation**: System generates new sentence using learned vocabulary
4. **FSRS Update**: Card parameters updated based on rating
5. **Database Storage**: Updated card and review log saved

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Google Gemini API (recommended)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
export GEMINI_MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.5-flash" # Example: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash

# OpenAI API (alternative)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-3.5-turbo" # Example: gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### API Service Selection

```python
# Choose AI service (Gemini recommended)
ai_service = AIServiceFactory.create_service("gemini", model_name="gemini-2.5-flash")

# Choose AI service (OpenAI alternative)
ai_service = AIServiceFactory.create_service("openai", model_name="gpt-4")
```

## 🐳 Containerization

### Using Podman (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and run with Podman
podman build -t morphcards .
podman run -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env morphcards

# Using Podman Compose (uses .env file)
podman-compose up -d
```

### Using Docker (Alternative)

```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t morphcards .
docker run -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env morphcards

# Using Docker Compose (uses .env file)
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🚀 Quick Start with Makefile

```bash
# Run everything at once (recommended)
make all

# Or use individual commands
make build      # Build container
make demo       # Run demo in container (one-shot)
make demo-local # Run demo locally (requires install)
make demo-quick # Quick local demo (auto-install)
make run        # Build and run
make clean      # Clean up
make help       # Show all commands
```

**Note**: The Makefile assumes podman is being used. For docker users, replace `podman` with `docker` in the Makefile or use the container commands directly.

**Local Development**: For development and testing, use `make demo-quick` which installs dependencies locally and runs the demo without containers.

**Note**: If you encounter pip version issues, the container-based demo (`make demo`) is recommended as it uses a fresh Python environment.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=morphcards

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
```

## 📊 Demo Interface

Start the interactive demo:

```bash
# Run demo locally
python -m morphcards.demo

# Or use the CLI

- **Statistics**: View learning progress and vocabulary stats
- **Optimization**: Optimize FSRS parameters

## 🔍 API Reference

### Core Classes

#### `Card`
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `word`: Word to learn
- `sentence`: Current sentence
- `original_sentence`: Original sentence when created
- `stability`: FSRS stability parameter (nullable)
- `difficulty`: FSRS difficulty parameter (nullable)
- `due_date`: Next review date
- `state`: FSRS state (New, Learning, Review, Relearning)

#### `Scheduler`
- `review_card()`: Process card review and generate new sentence
- `_fsrs`: Internal FSRS scheduler instance (manages parameters internally)

#### `VocabularyDatabase`
- `add_card()`: Add new card
- `get_due_cards()`: Get cards ready for review
- `get_learned_vocabulary()`: Get all learned words
- `add_review_log()`: Record review completion (now stores UUID for review logs)
- `stability` and `difficulty` in cards table are now nullable.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Demo Issues

**Demo won't start**: Make sure port 7860 is available. Use a different port with `-p 8080:7860` if needed.

**API key errors**: Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct API key. For Gemini users: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`. For OpenAI users: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key`.

**Slow first run**: The one-shot demo downloads dependencies on first run. Subsequent runs will be faster.

**Permission denied**: On some systems, you may need to run podman with `sudo` or configure user namespaces.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :7860

# Kill process using port
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:7860)

# Run on different port
podman run --rm -p 8080:7860 --env-file .env \
  docker.io/library/python:3.11-slim \
  bash -c "pip install morphcards[demo] && python -m morphcards.demo"

# Note: Your .env file should contain either GEMINI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY
```
