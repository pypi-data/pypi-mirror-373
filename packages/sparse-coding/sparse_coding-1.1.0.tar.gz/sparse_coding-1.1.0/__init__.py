Sparse Coding Library
Based on: Olshausen & Field (1996) "Emergence of Simple-Cell Receptive Field Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Images"

This library implements the revolutionary sparse coding algorithm that discovers
edge-like features from natural images, forming the foundation of modern computer vision.
