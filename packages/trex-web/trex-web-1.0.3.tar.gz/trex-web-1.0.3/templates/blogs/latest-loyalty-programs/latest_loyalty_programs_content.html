	<h3 class="fs-3 mt-5">How to create a customer loyalty program</h3>

		<li class="mb-1">

		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">

	<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app/assets/img/blogs/latest-loyalty-programs/creating-an-effective-loyalty-program.webp')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid custom-img-width">
	</div>
	
	<h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Figure out your goals</h4>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	The first step in developing a customer loyalty program is to determine 
	what you want to get out of it. This includes setting goals, 
	such as the type of shopping behavior you want to promote:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="">
		<li class="mb-1">
			Repeat purchases/visits
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Purchasing a specific product
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Customer Reviews
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Referrals
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Funding
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Once you identify the areas of your business that you want to target, 
	you'll be able to decide on your program type.
	</p>
	
	<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app/assets/img/blogs/latest-loyalty-programs/goals-of-customer-loyalty-programs.webp')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid custom-img-width">
	</div>
	
	<h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Choose the type of reward</h4>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Next, pick the reward you want to offer to customers. 
	Bear in mind that you’ll want to make your reward desirable enough 
	to keep customers interested, encourage repeat purchases, and foster brand loyalty. 
	Types of rewards can include:
	<ul class="">
		<li class="mb-1">
			Cash voucher
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Discount voucher
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Product/Service voucher
		</li>
		<li class="mb-1">
			Prepaid Credit
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Select the type of loyalty program</h4>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Choose the type of customer loyalty program that best aligns with 
	your goal and marketing plan.
	 
	</p>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Example, if you want to raise funding, you can launch prepaid program to customers who trust and love
	your brand. You can offer extra bonus credit which is higher than bank saving interest as return. 
	 
	</p>
	
	<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app/assets/img/blogs/latest-loyalty-programs/compare-incentives-to-attract-loyal-customers.webp')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid custom-img-width">
	</div>
	
	<h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Decide how you want to run your program</h4>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	After you choose the type of program you want, determine whether you want to run your program manually or with software.
	 
	</p>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Running your program manually would require you to track customer behaviors by hand and 
	reward them based on your structure - like with a punch card. 
	It's much easier to track this data using automated software, 
	especially one that integrates with other tools, such as your POS system. 
	 
	</p>
	
	<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app/assets/img/blogs/latest-loyalty-programs/manual-vs-automated.webp')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid custom-img-width">
	</div>
	
	<h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Observe and fine tune</h4>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	Lastly, be sure to monitor how your customer loyalty program performs and adjust based 
	on what you see and any feedback you receive. You can gather insights 
	from your customer loyalty program software or calculate the program participation rate.
	 
	</p>
	<p class=" mt-2">
	The participation rate shows you how many customers are interested in your program. 
	To calculate this metric, divide the number of loyalty program members by 
	the total number of customers.
