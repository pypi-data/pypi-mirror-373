				<h2>Your Privacy Is Important to Us</h2>
				<p>
				    The goal of the {{ branding_text }} is to allow you to participate in as many Loyalty/Rewards programs as you desire  
				    <strong>("Purpose")</strong> 
					{{ branding_text }} understands the key is by protecting your personal information that you have provided to {{ branding_text }} 
					<strong>("Personal Data")</strong>. 
					{{ branding_text }} allows you to participate in brand owner programs by giving all parties the best of all worlds.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Although you are not obliged to provide us with your Personal Data, you will not be able to enjoy the {{ branding_text }} service, 
				    where the Personal Data is what is required to establish a {{ branding_text }} Account, if you fail to provide all requested 
				    information.    
				</p>
				<p>
				    Your Personal Data may be disclosed to Brand Owner whom you are enrolled in their program with {{ branding_text }},
				    which exists or is formed from time to time for the Purpose or to fulfill some legal or regulatory function or is reasonably 
				    required in the interest of the Loyalty/Rewards programs. Only Brand owners with whom you enrolled with can advertise and
				    make offers on your private rewards statement page. If a Brand Owner becomes bothersome in its interaction with you through
				    {{ branding_text }}, you can turn them off without leaving their rewards program. You have complete control over your 
				    relationship and communication with each Brand Owner.

                    Our privacy policy does not apply to your Brand Owners' privacy policies and vice versa. So, you need to read and understand
                    your Brand Owners' policies independently of our policy. Also, a Brand Owner may already have your Personal Data as a result of
                    your prior participation in its rewards program and the subsequent link to your {{ branding_text }} account.

                <p>
                    We may also use your Personal Data to interact directly with you for a specific purpose, such as resolving a problem that 
                    you may have with your {{ branding_text }} account.                    
                </p>

                    research or promotional purposes without your consent. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    guidelines issued by regulatory or other relevant authorities, if we reasonably believe that we have a lawful right to 
                    disclose your Personal Data to any third party or that we would have had your consent for such disclosure if you had 
                    known of the same, and/or if the disclosure is in the public interest.
                </p>
