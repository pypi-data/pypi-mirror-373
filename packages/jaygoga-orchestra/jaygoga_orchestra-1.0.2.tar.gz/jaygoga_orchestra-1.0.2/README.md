## 🎯 Quick Start

### 🏛️ Classical Orchestration (v1) - Structured & Reliable

Perfect for **structured workflows**, **enterprise environments**, and **predictable processes**.

```python
from jaygoga_orchestra.v1 import Agent, Task, Squad, Process

# Create specialized agents
analyst = Agent(
    role="Senior Data Analyst",
    goal="Extract meaningful insights from complex datasets",
    backstory="You are a seasoned analyst with 10+ years of experience in data science and business intelligence."
)

researcher = Agent(
    role="Market Researcher",
    goal="Gather comprehensive market intelligence",
    backstory="You specialize in market analysis and competitive intelligence gathering."
)

# Define specific tasks
analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze Q4 sales data and identify key trends, patterns, and anomalies",
    agent=analyst,
    expected_output="Detailed analysis report with visualizations and recommendations"
)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research market conditions and competitor performance in Q4",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="Market intelligence report with competitor analysis"
)

# Create coordinated squad
intelligence_squad = Squad(
    agents=[analyst, researcher],
    tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the orchestrated workflow
results = intelligence_squad.execute()
print(f"Analysis Complete: {results}")
```

### 🚀 Modern Orchestration (v2) - Dynamic & Intelligent

Ideal for **adaptive workflows**, **AI-driven decisions**, and **dynamic environments**.

```python
from jaygoga_orchestra.v2 import Agent, Team, Workflow

# Create intelligent agents with advanced capabilities
data_agent = Agent(
    name="JayGoga_DataSage",
    description="Advanced AI agent specialized in data analysis with deep learning capabilities",
    instructions="You are an expert data scientist with the ability to adapt your analysis approach based on data characteristics",
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["python_interpreter", "data_visualization", "statistical_analysis"]
)

insight_agent = Agent(
    name="JayGoga_InsightMaster",
    description="Strategic insight generator with business acumen",
    instructions="Transform data findings into actionable business strategies and recommendations",
    model="claude-3-sonnet",
    tools=["business_analysis", "report_generation", "strategic_planning"]
)

# Create dynamic team with shared context
intelligence_team = Team(
    agents=[data_agent, insight_agent],
    name="Strategic Intelligence Unit",
    description="Elite team for comprehensive business intelligence",
    shared_memory=True,
    collaboration_mode="adaptive"
)


# Execute with dynamic adaptation
results = intelligence_team.run(
    task="Analyze our Q4 performance data and provide strategic recommendations for Q1",
    context={"data_source": "sales_db", "priority": "high", "deadline": "2024-01-15"}
)

print(f"Strategic Analysis: {results.summary}")
print(f"Key Insights: {results.insights}")
print(f"Recommendations: {results.recommendations}")
```
