# StatLine

**StatLine™ — weighted player scoring, efficiency modeling, and tooling.**

## What is StatLine?

StatLine is an adapter-driven analytics framework that:

- normalizes raw game stats,
- computes per-metric scores (with clamps, inversion, and ratios),
- aggregates into buckets and applies weight presets (e.g., pri),
- exposes a clean CLI and library API,
- optionally ingests Google Sheets and caches mapped rows.

Supported Python:

- **3.10 – 3.13** (tested in CI across Linux, macOS, Windows)

---

## Install

Base install:

```bash
# pip
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # use .\.venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install statline
```

With extras:

```bash
# Google Sheets ingestion
pip install "statline[sheets]"

# Developer tools (linters, types, tests)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## CLI Basics

StatLine installs a console script `statline`. You can also call the module directly.

```bash
statline --help
python -m statline.cli --help
```

### Common commands

```bash
# list bundled adapters
statline adapters

# interactive scoring REPL (banner + timing are enabled by default)
statline interactive

# score a file of rows (CSV or YAML understood by the adapter)
statline score --adapter example_game stats.csv

# write results to a CSV instead of stdout
statline score --adapter example_game stats.csv --out results.csv
```

Subcommands:

- `adapters` — show available adapter keys & aliases
- `interactive` — guided prompts + timing table
- `export-csv` — export cached mapped metrics (when using the cache/Sheets flow)
- `score` — batch-score a CSV/YAML through an adapter

When the CLI runs, you’ll see a banner (noted so you can confirm proper install):

```diff
=== StatLine — Adapter-Driven Scoring ===
```

Enable per-stage timing via env (eg: 14ms):

```bash
STATLINE_TIMING=1 statline score --adapter rbw5 stats.csv
```

---

## Input formats

StatLine reads **CSV** or **YAML**. The columns/keys must match what the adapter expects.

### CSV

- First row is the header.
- Each subsequent row is an entity (player).
- Provide whatever **raw** fields your adapter maps (e.g., `ppg, apg, fgm, fga, tov`).

```cs
display_name,team,ppg,apg,orpg,drpg,spg,bpg,fgm,fga,tov
Jordan,Red,27.3,4.8,1.2,3.6,1.9,0.7,10.2,22.1,2.1
```

### Example adapter (yaml)

Adapters define the schema for raw inputs, buckets, weights, and any derived metrics.
Below is the `example.yaml` you can ship in `statline/core/adapters/defs/`:

```yaml
key: example_game
version: 0.1.0
aliases: [ex, sample]
title: Example Game

dimensions:
  map:   { values: [MapA, MapB, MapC] }
  side:  { values: [Attack, Defense] }
  role:  { values: [Carry, Support, Flex] }
  mode:  { values: [Pro, Ranked, Scrim] }

buckets:
  scoring: {}
  impact: {}
  utility: {}
  survival: {}
  discipline: {}

metrics:
  # direct fields
  - { key: stat3_count, bucket: utility,    clamp: [0, 50],  source: { field: stat3_count } }
  - { key: mistakes,    bucket: discipline, clamp: [0, 25], invert: true, source: { field: mistakes } }

# ratios/derived — replace old mapping math
efficiency:
  - { key: stat1_per_round, make: raw["stat1_total"], attempt: raw["rounds_played"], bucket: scoring }
  - { key: stat2_rate,      make: raw["stat2_numer"], attempt: raw["stat2_denom"],   bucket: impact }
  - { key: stat4_quality,   make: raw["stat4_good"],  attempt: raw["stat4_total"],   bucket: survival }

weights:
  pri:
    scoring:    0.30
    impact:     0.28
    utility:    0.16
    survival:   0.16
    discipline: 0.10
  mvp:
    scoring:    0.34
    impact:     0.30
    utility:    0.12
    survival:   0.14
    discipline: 0.10
  support:
    scoring:    0.16
    impact:     0.18
    utility:    0.40
    survival:   0.16
    discipline: 0.10

penalties:
  pri:     { discipline: 0.10 }
  mvp:     { discipline: 0.12 }
  support: { discipline: 0.08 }

sniff:
  require_any_headers: [stat1_total, stat2_numer, stat2_denom, rounds_played, mistakes]
```

Reference `HOWTO.md` should you have any questions regarding adapters and yaml formatting.
