llm-toolchain

Giving LLMs the tools for real impact, simply.

llm-toolchain is a lightweight, straightforward Python library designed to make it incredibly easy to connect Large Language Models with external functions and tools. It puts simplicity and control first, allowing you to enhance LLMs for personal automation, increase their reliability, and integrate them into your projects without relying on complex, multi-layered frameworks.

Philosophy

The goal of llm-toolchain is to provide the power of tool-use in a simple, intuitive package. It's built for developers who want to:

    Maintain Control: Directly interact with LLM providers without intermediaries.

    Keep it Simple: Use a minimal, clean API that gets the job done without boilerplate.

    Be Flexible: Easily extend the library with custom adapters for any LLM and custom selectors for any logic.

    Automate Personal Tasks: Create reliable agents for tasks like sending emails, managing files, or interacting with your personal APIs.

Key Features ‚ú®

    Universal Adapters: A powerful adapter system allows llm-toolchain to work with virtually any LLM, whether it has native function-calling or not. Pre-built adapters for OpenAI, Google Gemini, Vertex AI, and a generic PromptAdapter are included.

    Semantic Tool Selector: Intelligently and automatically selects the most relevant tools for a given prompt from a larger collection using vector embeddings, saving tokens and improving accuracy.

    Simple & Lightweight: With a minimal API and a focus on core functionality, the library is easy to learn and integrate into any project.

    Easily Extensible: Write your own adapters, selectors, and tools with simple class inheritance. If you can write a Python function, you can give it to an LLM as a tool.

Installation üöÄ

The base library is lightweight. You install the specific dependencies for the LLM providers you want to use as "extras".
Core Installation

pip install llm-toolchain

Extras for LLM Providers

Install the extras needed for the specific models you plan to use.

For Google Gemini:

pip install 'llm-toolchain[gemini]'

For OpenAI:

pip install openai

For Google Vertex AI:

pip install google-cloud-aiplatform

Environment Variables

You will also need to set up your API keys in a .env file in your project's root directory:

# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
GEMINI_PROJECT_ID="..." # Required for Vertex AI

Quick Start ‚ö°

Here is the simplest way to get started. In just a few lines of code, you can give a Gemini model a custom tool and have it execute a function call.

# file: main.py
import os
from google import generativeai as genai
import dotenv
from llm_toolchain import Toolchain, GenAIAdapter, tool

# --- 1. Define a tool ---
# The @tool decorator automatically prepares your function for the LLM.
# The docstring is crucial - it's used as the description for the LLM and the selector.
@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """
    Gets the current weather for a specified city.
    Returns a string describing the weather.
    """
    # Dummy implementation for this example
    if "new york" in city.lower():
        return "It is currently 75¬∞F and sunny in New York City."
    else:
        return f"Weather data for {city} is not available."

# --- 2. Set up the LLM and Toolchain ---
dotenv.load_dotenv()
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

# The client and adapter handle communication with the LLM
llm_client = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
adapter = GenAIAdapter()

# The Toolchain orchestrates everything
chain = Toolchain(
    llm_client=llm_client,
    adapter=adapter,
    tools=[get_weather] # Pass the list of available tools
)

# --- 3. Run the Toolchain ---
prompt = "What's the weather like in New York City today?"
response = chain.run(prompt=prompt)

print(response)
# Expected Output: It is currently 75¬∞F and sunny in New York City.

Advanced Usage
Using Different LLMs

Switching between LLM providers is as simple as changing the client and adapter.
OpenAI

from openai import OpenAI
from llm_toolchain import OpenAIAdapter # Use the OpenAIAdapter

llm_client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
adapter = OpenAIAdapter()

chain = Toolchain(llm_client=llm_client, adapter=adapter, tools=[...])

Google Vertex AI

import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
from llm_toolchain import VertexAIAdapter # Use the VertexAIAdapter

project_id = os.getenv("GEMINI_PROJECT_ID")
vertexai.init(project=project_id, location="us-central1")
llm_client = GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
adapter = VertexAIAdapter()

chain = Toolchain(llm_client=llm_client, adapter=adapter, tools=[...])

The PromptAdapter (for any LLM)

For models that don't support native tool-calling, the PromptAdapter injects tool definitions and JSON formatting instructions directly into the system prompt.

from llm_toolchain import PromptAdapter # Use the PromptAdapter

# Use any LLM client, for example, Gemini
llm_client = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
adapter = PromptAdapter()

chain = Toolchain(llm_client=llm_client, adapter=adapter, tools=[...])

Using the SemanticToolSelector

Instead of passing a small list of tools to the Toolchain, you can provide a SemanticToolSelector with a large library of tools. It will automatically select and provide the most relevant ones to the LLM for each specific prompt.

from llm_toolchain import SemanticToolSelector
from llm_toolchain import tools # Assuming you have a tools package

all_my_tools = [
    tools.get_weather,
    tools.send_email,
    tools.read_file,
    # ... and dozens more
]

selector = SemanticToolSelector(all_tools=all_my_tools)

chain = Toolchain(
    llm_client=llm_client,
    adapter=adapter,
    selector=selector # Pass the selector instead of the 'tools' list
)

# The chain will now use the selector to pick the best tools for this prompt
chain.run("What's the weather in Berlin and then email the result to my boss?")

Extending the Toolchain üßë‚Äçüíª

llm-toolchain is designed to be easily extended.
Creating a Custom Tool

Simply decorate any Python function with @tool. A descriptive docstring is required, as it will be used to tell the LLM and the selector what the tool does.

from llm_toolchain import tool

@tool
def calculate_compound_interest(principal: float, rate: float, time: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the compound interest for a given principal, rate, and time.
    """
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** time

Creating a Custom Adapter

You can support any LLM API by inheriting from BaseAdapter.

from llm_toolchain.adapters import BaseAdapter

class MyCustomAdapter(BaseAdapter):
    def _get_run_strategies(self):
        # Return possible paths to the LLM's run method
        return [['run_llm']]

    def _get_parse_strategies(self):
        # Return possible paths to the response content
        return [['response', 'text']]

    def _build_request(self, messages, tools, **kwargs):
        # Format the request payload for your custom LLM
        return {"prompt": messages[-1]['content'], **kwargs}

    def generate_schema(self, tool):
        # Format the tool's schema for your custom LLM
        return f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}"

Creating a Custom Selector

Implement any logic for tool selection by inheriting from BaseSelector.

from llm_toolchain.selectors import BaseSelector

class MyKeywordSelector(BaseSelector):
    def select_tools(self, prompt: str):
        selected = set()
        for tool in self.all_tools:
            if tool.name in prompt:
                selected.add(tool)
        return selected

Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This library is actively being developed. The next major planned feature is:

    Interactive UI: A user interface for real-time control, observation, and correction of LLM tool calls, giving you complete oversight of the agent's actions.
