def vma(df: pd.DataFrame, parameters: dict = None, columns: dict = None) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculates the Volume Moving Average (VMA), which is a weighted moving average
    that uses volume as the weighting factor.
    
    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the data.
        parameters (dict, optional): Dictionary containing calculation parameters:
            - window (int): The lookback period for calculation. Default is 20.
        columns (dict, optional): Dictionary containing column name mappings:
            - close_col (str): The column name for closing prices. Default is 'Close'.
            - volume_col (str): The column name for volume. Default is 'Volume'.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the VMA series and a list of column names.
    
    VMA gives more weight to price moves accompanied by higher volume, making it
    more responsive to significant market movements than a simple moving average.
    
    The formula is:
    VMA = Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume), calculated over the specified window.
    
    Use Cases:
    
    - Trend identification: VMA can be used similarly to other moving averages to
      identify trends, but with more emphasis on volume-supported price movements.
    - Dynamic support/resistance: VMA can act as support in uptrends and resistance
      in downtrends.
    - Entry/exit signals: Crossovers between price and VMA or between multiple VMAs
      with different periods can generate trading signals.
    - Volume-validated price movement: VMA filters out price movements that occur on
      low volume, focusing on more significant market activity.
    - Divergence analysis: Comparing VMA to other moving averages can highlight periods
      where price moves are or aren't supported by volume.
