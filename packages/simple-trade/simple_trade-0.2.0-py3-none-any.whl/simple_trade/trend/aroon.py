def aroon(df: pd.DataFrame, parameters: dict = None, columns: dict = None) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculates the Aroon indicator, which measures the time it takes for a security
    to reach its highest and lowest points over a specified time period.
    
    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The dataframe containing price data. Must have high and low columns.
        parameter (dict): The parameter dictionary includes the lookback period for calculation.
        columns (dict): The column dictionary that includes high and low column names.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing aroon_up, aroon_down, aroon_oscillator values and column names.
    
    The Aroon indicator consists of three components:
    
    1. Aroon Up: Measures the number of periods since the highest price within the
       lookback period and is calculated as:
       Aroon Up = ((period - periods since highest high) / period) * 100
    
    2. Aroon Down: Measures the number of periods since the lowest price within the
       lookback period and is calculated as:
       Aroon Down = ((period - periods since lowest low) / period) * 100
       
    3. Aroon Oscillator: The difference between Aroon Up and Aroon Down:
       Aroon Oscillator = Aroon Up - Aroon Down
    
    Interpretation:
    
    - Aroon Up/Down range between 0 and 100
    - Aroon Up values close to 100 indicate a strong uptrend
    - Aroon Down values close to 100 indicate a strong downtrend
    - When Aroon Up crosses above Aroon Down, it may signal a bullish trend
    - When Aroon Down crosses above Aroon Up, it may signal a bearish trend
    - The Aroon Oscillator ranges from -100 to 100:
      - Positive values indicate an uptrend
      - Negative values indicate a downtrend
      - Values near zero indicate consolidation or weak trends
    
    Use Cases:
    
    - Trend identification: Determine the direction and strength of the current trend.
    - Trend exhaustion: Identify when a trend is losing momentum before a reversal.
    - Consolidation detection: When both Aroon Up and Down are low, it suggests 
      price consolidation.
    - Breakout confirmation: A strong move in Aroon Up/Down can confirm a price breakout.
    - Crossover signals: When Aroon Up crosses above/below Aroon Down, it may indicate
      a potential trend change.
