**Don't use in production yet.**
I will probably introduce backwards incompatible changes

Process images with less boilerplate and more flexibility than you've ever dreamed of.

- loading images in a specific colorspace (RGB, HSV, grayscale, and more) with a single command
- converting image colorspaces
- The functions accept numpy arrays and Pillow images as input and return the same type
- defining the shapes to be drawn on top of an image in a declarative way as a list of dicts and passing it to draw()
- Many more (TODO: Link to tocs)

## Example (TODO)

## Installation
First, install opencv, which is not added as dependency so you can install the contrib/headless versions
```bash
if [[ ! $(pip freeze | grep -Pi 'opencv') ]]; then
    pip install opencv-python
fi
```
Then, install this package
```bash
pip install katalytic-images
```

## Roadmap
- make pillow an optional dependency.
   - setup_load_image() should pick opencv if pillow is not available
- image thresholding and masking operations
- interactive data exploration widgets (maybe as part of another package)
- higher level API on top of opencv
- utilities for video processing

## Contributing
