## Style Guide

### Docstrings

Use [NumPy-style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) for documenting functions, classes, and modules.

### Code Formatting

The code should follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines. Use [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (with default settings) for linting and formatting:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Documentation

Project documentation is located in the `docs/` directory. It is written in reStructuredText (`.rst`) and built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com).

To build the docs locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
