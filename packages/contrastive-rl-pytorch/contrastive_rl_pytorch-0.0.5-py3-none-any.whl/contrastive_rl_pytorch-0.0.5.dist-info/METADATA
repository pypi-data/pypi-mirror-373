## contrastive-rl (wip)

For following a [new line of research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07568) that started in 2022 from [Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/) et al.

## install

```shell
$ pip install contrastive-rl-pytorch
```

## usage

```python
import torch
from contrastive_rl_pytorch import ContrastiveRLTrainer
from x_mlps_pytorch import MLP

encoder = MLP(16, 256, 128)

trainer = ContrastiveRLTrainer(encoder)

trajectories = torch.randn(256, 512, 16)

trainer(trajectories, 100)

# train for 100 steps and save

torch.save(encoder.state_dict(), './trained.pt')
```
