PolyNOM — Polypheny Native Object Mapper

**PolyNOM** is a powerful Python-based object mapping layer designed to work seamlessly with [Polypheny](https://polypheny.com), the flexible and distributed data management platform. It leverages the [`Polypheny Connector Python`](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-Connector-Python) to simplify the development process by providing automatic object mapping, schema migration, and changelog tracking.

PolyNOM allows developers to work with Python classes and objects, while automatically handling the communication and translation with a Polypheny instance — either via Docker or direct host/port configuration.
