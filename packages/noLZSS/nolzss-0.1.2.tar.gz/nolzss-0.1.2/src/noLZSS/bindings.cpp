/**
 * @file bindings.cpp
 * @brief Python bindings for the noLZSS factorization library.
 *
 * This file contains the Python bindings for the non-overlapping Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski
 * factorization algorithm. The bindings provide both in-memory and file-based factorization
 * capabilities with proper GIL management for performance.
 *
 * The module exposes the following functions:
 * - factorize(): Factorize in-memory text
 * - factorize_file(): Factorize text from file
 * - count_factors(): Count factors in text
 * - count_factors_file(): Count factors in file
 * - write_factors_binary_file(): Write factors to binary file
 *
 * All functions require input data to end with '$' sentinel for correct factorization.

This is the main factorization function for in-memory text processing.
It accepts any Python bytes-like object and returns a list of (start, length) tuples.

Args:
    data: Python bytes-like object containing text that must end with '$' sentinel

Returns:
    List of (start, length) tuples representing the factorization

Raises:
    ValueError: if data is not a valid bytes-like object

Note:
    The input data must end with '$' sentinel for correct factorization.
    GIL is released during computation for better performance with large data.

Reads text from a file and performs factorization. This is more memory-efficient

Args:

Returns:

Note:

    Use reserve_hint for better performance when you know approximate factor count.
