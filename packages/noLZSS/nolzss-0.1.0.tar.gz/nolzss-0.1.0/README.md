**Non-overlapping Lempel‚ÄìZiv‚ÄìStorer‚ÄìSzymanski factorization**

High-performance Python library for text factorization using compressed suffix trees. The library provides efficient algorithms for finding non-overlapping factors in text data, with both in-memory and file-based processing capabilities. Based on a paper by Dominik K√∂ppl - [Non-Overlapping LZ77 Factorization and LZ78 Substring Compression Queries with Suffix Trees](https://doi.org/10.3390/a14020044)

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Uses compressed suffix trees (SDSL) for optimal factorization speed
- üíæ **Memory Efficient**: File-based processing for large datasets without loading everything into memory
- üêç **Python Bindings**: Easy-to-use Python interface with proper GIL management
- üìä **Multiple Output Formats**: Get factors as lists, counts, or binary files
- üîß **Flexible API**: Support for both strings and files with optional performance hints

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmerKerner/noLZSS.git
cd noLZSS
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.20+

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import noLZSS

# Factorize a text string (must end with '$' sentinel)
text = b"abracadabra$"
factors = noLZSS.factorize(text)
print(factors)  # [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 4)]
```

### Working with Files

```python
# Factorize text from a file
factors = noLZSS.factorize_file("large_text.txt")
print(f"Found {len(factors)} factors")

# Just count factors without storing them (memory efficient)
count = noLZSS.count_factors_file("large_text.txt")
print(f"Total factors: {count}")

# Write factors to binary file for later processing
noLZSS.write_factors_binary_file("input.txt", "factors.bin")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Use reserve hint for better performance - An estimate of the number of compressed factors
factors = noLZSS.factorize_file("data.txt", reserve_hint=1000)

# Process factors efficiently
for start, length in factors:
    substring = text[start:start+length]
    print(f"Factor at {start}: '{substring}' (length {length})")
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `factorize(data)`
Factorize in-memory text into LZSS factors.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (bytes-like): Input text that must end with '$' sentinel character

**Returns:**
- `List[Tuple[int, int]]`: List of (start, length) tuples representing factors

**Example:**
```python
factors = noLZSS.factorize(b"hello$")
# Returns: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]
```

#### `factorize_file(path, reserve_hint=0)`
Factorize text from a file into LZSS factors.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str): Path to input file containing text that must end with '$' sentinel
- `reserve_hint` (int, optional): Hint for reserving space in output vector

**Returns:**
- `List[Tuple[int, int]]`: List of (start, length) tuples representing factors

#### `count_factors(data)`
Count LZSS factors in text without storing them.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (bytes-like): Input text that must end with '$' sentinel character

**Returns:**
- `int`: Number of factors in the factorization

#### `count_factors_file(path)`
Count LZSS factors in a file without storing them.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str): Path to input file containing text that must end with '$' sentinel

**Returns:**
- `int`: Number of factors in the factorization

#### `write_factors_binary_file(in_path, out_path, assume_has_sentinel=False)`
Write LZSS factors from input file to binary output file.

**Parameters:**
- `in_path` (str): Path to input file containing text that must end with '$' sentinel
- `out_path` (str): Path to output file for binary factors
- `assume_has_sentinel` (bool, optional): Unused parameter for API consistency

**Returns:**
- `int`: Number of factors written

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sentinel Requirement**: All input strings and files **must** end with the '$' character. This is essential for correct factorization results.

```python
# Correct usage
text = b"hello$"
factors = noLZSS.factorize(text)

# Incorrect usage (will produce wrong results)
text = b"hello"  # Missing '$' sentinel
```

## Algorithm Details

The library implements the **Non-overlapping Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski (LZSS)** factorization algorithm using:

- **Compressed Suffix Trees**: Built using the SDSL (Succinct Data Structure Library)
- **Range Minimum Queries**: For efficient lowest common ancestor computations
- **Sink-based Processing**: Memory-efficient processing using callback functions


## Performance

- **Time Complexity**: ùí™(ùëõ lg<sup>œµ</sup> ùëõ) for factorization, where n is input length, and ùúñ ‚àà (0,1]
- **Space Complexity**: ùí™(ùëõlgùúé) for suffix tree construction, where ùúé is the alphabet size
- **Memory Usage**: File-based processing uses minimal memory for large files
