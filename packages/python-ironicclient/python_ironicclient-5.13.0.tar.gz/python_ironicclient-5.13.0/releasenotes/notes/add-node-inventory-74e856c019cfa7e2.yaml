    Adds support for API version ``1.81``, allowing users to retrieve a node's
    hardware inventory using the
    ``baremetal node inventory [--file <filename>] save <node>`` command.
  - Adds a ``get_inventory`` method to the python client library. This method
    allows operators to query recorded node inventory from an ironic API.
