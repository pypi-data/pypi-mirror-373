    Adds support for API version ``1.78`` and "node history" functionality
    allowing users to query a list of events, and retrieve a single history
    event from a baremetal node.
  - Adds ``get_history_list`` and ``get_history_event`` methods to the python
    client library. These methods allow operators to query recorded node event
    information from an ironic API, where supported and enabled.
