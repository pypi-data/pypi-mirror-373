# Geometry Library

A simple Python library for 2D geometry, including core concepts like points, lines, circles, rectangles, and polygons, with basic operations such as calculating distance, area, and perimeter.

## Features

-   **Point**: Represents a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates.
-   **Line**: Represents a line defined by two points.
-   **Circle**: Represents a circle defined by a center point and a radius.
-   **Rectangle**: Represents a rectangle defined by its top-left corner, width, and height.
-   **Polygon**: Represents a polygon defined by a list of points.
-   Basic operations:
    -   Distance between points
    -   Length of a line
    -   Area and perimeter of circles, rectangles, and polygons

## Installation

Assuming you have the library code in a directory named `geometry_library_package` with the correct structure (including `setup.py`), you can install it locally using pip:
