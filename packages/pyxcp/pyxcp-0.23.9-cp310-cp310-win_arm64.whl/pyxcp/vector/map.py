"""
3.0  Automatic detection sequence

-  The master (CANape) sends the command GET_ID with the idType = 219 (0xDB hex) to the ECU
-  The ECU sets the MTA (memory transfer address) pointer to the first byte of the data block containing the
MAP file identification and returns the number of bytes which need to be uploaded to the master as well as
the counter which defines the appropriate memory segment
-  The master requests the specified number of bytes from the ECU by sending UPLOAD commands
-  The master looks for the appropriate MAP file in the MAP file directory and updates the addresses in the
a2l file accordingly
