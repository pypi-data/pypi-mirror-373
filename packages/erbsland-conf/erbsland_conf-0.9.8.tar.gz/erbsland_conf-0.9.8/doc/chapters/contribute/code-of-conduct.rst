Our Commitment
==============

We’re committed to fostering an open, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the Erbsland Configuration Parser for Python project. As contributors and maintainers, we want participation in our community to be a positive and harassment-free experience for people of all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels.

This includes, but is not limited to, individuals of any age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education level, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

Our Standards
=============

We believe a respectful and supportive environment makes collaboration more effective and enjoyable. Positive contributions to our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being considerate of different perspectives and experiences.
- Accepting constructive feedback with grace.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community.
- Showing empathy and kindness to others.

At the same time, we do not tolerate behaviors that undermine this environment. These include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advances.
- Trolling, making insulting or derogatory remarks, or launching personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in any form, public or private.
- Sharing someone else’s private information without explicit permission.
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Our Responsibilities
====================

Project maintainers are responsible for clearly defining acceptable behavior and are expected to act fairly and appropriately when issues arise. They may take actions such as removing or editing contributions, or banning individuals who behave inappropriately, threaten others, or otherwise harm the community.

Scope
=====

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, both online and offline, and whenever someone is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting from a project’s social media account, or participating in public events as a community representative.

Project maintainers may provide further clarification about what constitutes representation of the project.

Reporting and Enforcement
=========================

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project team at `github@erbsland.dev <mailto:github@erbsland.dev>`_.

All reports will be taken seriously and handled with care and confidentiality. We will review and investigate every incident and respond in a way that we believe is fair and appropriate for the situation. The identity of anyone reporting an issue will be protected.

Maintainership carries responsibility. If a maintainer does not uphold this Code of Conduct in good faith, they may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including removal from the project.
