Even small contributions, such as improving documentation, fixing typos, or clarifying error messages, are valuable and appreciated.  

Pull Requests

About the Use of Artificial Intelligence
========================================

We value contributions that are thoughtfully crafted by humans.  
Using tools to improve clarity or catch mistakes is perfectly fine, but **all contributions must be reviewed and validated by you before submission**.  

To keep the project safe and maintainable:  

* We regularly scan the codebase for vulnerabilities and similar issues with automated tools.  
* Automatically generated issues or pull requests **without meaningful human input** will not be accepted.  

Our goal is to keep this project reliable, transparent, and easy to contribute to—for everyone.
