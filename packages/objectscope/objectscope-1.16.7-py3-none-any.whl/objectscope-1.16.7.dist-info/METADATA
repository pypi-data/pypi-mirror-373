ObjectScope package provides a simplier approach to model training and evaluation by building the works of Detectron2. The focus is further abstract away the grunt work while leaving room to directly interact with Detectron2.

Several utilities needed to aid the model development are provided. This includes extensive model evaluation and selection,

## Installation

objectscope is an extension of detectron2 hence should be installed in your system for it to work properly. You can install Detectron2 as follows:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git
```

Install objectscope using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install objectscope
```
