If you are going to update version, always update:
Delete jaganathanj.egg-info folder as well as dist... folder and then, you run
python -m build
twine upload dist/*

Your package is **100% ready** for PyPI. 🎉
You've got:

* ✅ `setup.py` — configured properly
* ✅ `pyproject.toml` — for modern builds
* ✅ `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt` — all clean
* ✅ `MANIFEST.in` — includes necessary files
* ✅ `__init__.py` — fully functional with welcome and command display
* ✅ No external dependencies
* ✅ Great branding + messaging

If the upload and testing gonna be frequent:
MAke sure, you use .pypirc with loction at Current Computer User, example: C:/Users/Jagan/.pypirc

where you must have TestPYPI and Pypi for testing and production respectively

---
Here's how to pip install from testpypi:
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple jaganathanj

To build:
python -m build

To upload to testpypi:
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

## 🚀 FINAL STEP: Publish to PyPI

### 🔧 One-time Setup

1. **Create a PyPI account**
   → Go to [https://pypi.org/account/register/](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
   → Verify your email

2. **Install required tools**

   ```bash
   pip install build twine
   ```

---

### 🏗️ Build your package

From the root directory (where `setup.py` lives):

```bash
python -m build
```

This will generate:

```
dist/
├── jaganathanj-1.0.10.tar.gz
└── jaganathanj-1.0.10-py3-none-any.whl
```

---

### 📤 Upload to PyPI

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

It will ask for your **PyPI username and password** (not GitHub credentials).

If successful, you'll see:

```
Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
...
View at:
https://pypi.org/project/jaganathanj/
```

---

### ✅ After That

Anywhere in the world, people (including you) can do:

```bash
pip install jaganathanj
```

Then:

```python
import jaganathanj
jaganathanj.about()
```

---

## 💡 (Optional But Recommended)

If you plan to keep updating it:

* Add `version="1.0.1"` or higher in `setup.py` for each update.
* Consider publishing to **TestPyPI** first for testing:

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

* Test install from there:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ jaganathanj
```

Let me know if you'd like help writing a **release note**, **PyPI long description**, or even a **launch post for LinkedIn/Reddit**. You're about to go live with something *no one forgets*! 🚀


One more thing, install that .pypirc at C:Users/user_name/.pypirc
