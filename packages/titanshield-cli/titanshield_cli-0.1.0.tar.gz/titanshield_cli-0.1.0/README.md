## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Fast APK Analysis:** Decompiles and scans your APK in minutes.
-   **High-Signal Rules:** Focuses on high-impact vulnerabilities with a low false-positive rate (hardcoded secrets, insecure configurations, weak cryptography, etc.).
-   **CI/CD Native Output:** Generates reports in SARIF format for native integration into the "Security" tab of your Pull Requests.
-   **Resource Control:** Allows you to limit the memory consumption of the JADX decompiler to fit any environment, from a local machine to a CI runner.
-   **Open-Core Engine:** A transparent, community-driven rule engine based on simple YAML files.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install titanshield-cli
```

(Prerequisites: A recent version of Java and the JADX decompiler must be installed and available in your system's PATH.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
- Using the CLI is straightforward. Just point it at your APK file.
- For a quick overview in your console:
```bash
titanshield /path/to/your/app.apk 
```

- To generate a SARIF report for your CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
titanshield /path/to/your/app.apk --output sarif --file results.sarif
```

- To control memory usage on resource-constrained machines:

```bash
# Limit the JADX decompiler to 2GB of RAM
titanshield /path/to/your/app.apk --max-mem 2g
```

## üìà Example: GitHub Actions Integration
Integrate TitanShield into your workflow in minutes and see security findings directly in your Pull Requests.

```Yaml
# .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
name: TitanShield SAST Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  sast_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Add your APK build step here (example)
      - name: Build APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleRelease

      - name: Run TitanShield Scan
        run: |
          pip install titanshield-cli
          titanshield app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk --output sarif --file results.sarif

      - name: Upload SARIF Results to GitHub Security
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
```
