# HyLight

HyLight stands for HYdrogen recombination LIne emission from ionized Gas in varying tHermal condiTions. It calculates the level population of the excited states in atomic hydrogen and hence the typical recombination line emissivity. The results are accurate under typical photoionised nebular conditions. 

## Installation

The package can be installed via
```
pip install hylightpy
```
