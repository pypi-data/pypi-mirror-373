        Parameters
        ----------

            an action. If you want to use any items, you should use them

            directly received by Neuro.**
        - `ephemeral_context`:
            If False, the context provided in the `state` and `query`
            parameters will be remembered by Neuro after the actions force
            is completed. If True, Neuro will only remember it for the
            duration of the actions force.
        - `action_names`:
            The names of the actions that Neuro should choose from.

        Raises `ValueError` if any action name is not currently registered.

        Could raise `UnicodeDecodeError` if data is unable to be decoded,

        result of her action!
        Please make sure to send this as soon as possible.
        It should usually be sent after validating the action parameters,
        before it is actually executed in-game

        Parameters
        ----------
        - `id_`:
            The id of the action that this result is for. This is grabbed
            from the action message directly.
        - `success`:
            Whether or not the action was successful. _If this is `false`
            and this action is part of an actions force, the whole actions
            force will be immediately retried by Neuro._
        - `message`:
            A plaintext message that describes what happened when the action
            was executed. If not successful, this should be an error
            message. If successful, this can either be empty, or provide a
            _small_ context to Neuro regarding the action she just took
            (e.g. `"Remember to not share this with anyone."`). **This
            information will be directly received by Neuro.**

        Since setting `success` to `false` will retry the action force if
        there was one, if the action was not successful but you don't want
        it to be retried, you should set `success` to `true` and provide an
        error message in the `message` field.
