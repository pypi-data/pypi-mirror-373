A comprehensive collection of data structures for Python implemented in C++

Current version: 0.0.0 (demo)
This is simply the template the project will be continued to build on

## Introduction
A project I made to try CPython API.

Implementing data structures every times you want to use them can be time consuming, 
this repo was created to implement many data structures and utilities ready of use 
and as efficient as possible.

## Features
- .linked: A submodule which includes classes and utilities about the linked 
list data structure.
  - NodeSingle(val, next): Raw singly linked node 
  - That's it (more to come: doubly linked list, several data structures 
  implemented on linked lists, including but not limited to stack, 
  loop, circ buffer, etc. And utilities such as searching, etc.)
