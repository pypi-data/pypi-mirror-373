    """
    Asynchronous base handler for non-blocking logging in Python applications.

    Overview:
        This handler serves as a base class for creating asynchronous logging handlers
        that process log records without blocking the main application flow.
        By default, `AsyncBaseHandler` provides a console logging backend that
        outputs log messages to the standard output. This backend can be disabled
        if desired, and additional backends (such as Redis) can be added in
        subclasses.

    Attributes:
        log_queues (dict): A dictionary of asyncio.Queue objects for each logging backend.
        logging_accept_event (asyncio.Event): Event to signal when the handler can accept new logs.
        logging_running_event (asyncio.Event): Event to signal when logging is active.
        log_workers (list): List of worker coroutine functions for processing log messages.
        log_workers_tasks (list): List of asyncio tasks for each worker, created in `start_logging`.
        log_queue_put_tasks (list): List of asyncio tasks for queue put operations.

    Methods:
        start_logging():
            Starts all worker tasks to process log records asynchronously.

        emit(record):
            Queues a log record for each backend if logging is active.

        stop_logging():
            Stops logging by clearing the event and waiting for all queues to complete.

        _console_worker():
            Worker coroutine to process console log records from the queue.
