# Notebooks

Notebooks in this documentation show the result of each cell after executing for a short duration (~100ms).

You can download the notebook with the button at the top right of the page for the notebook.

!!! note

    The [suppress-error][async_kernel.typing.Tags.suppress_error] tag is inserted in code cells to enable
    with generating documentation. The symbol 'âš ' is an indicator that the error was suppressed. Normally
    this is due to the timeout but there is no distinction on the type of error.
