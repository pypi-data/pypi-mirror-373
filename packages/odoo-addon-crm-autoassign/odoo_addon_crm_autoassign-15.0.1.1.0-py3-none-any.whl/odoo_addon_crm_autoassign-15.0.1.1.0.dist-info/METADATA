To use this module, you need to:

* The assignment of opportunities will be done automatically every 30 minutes.

* It can be done manually per sales team by clicking on 'Assign opportunities' from the sales team view.

Note that opportunities will be assigned in order of creation date. That is, the oldest opportunities are assigned first and then the most recent ones.


ROADMAP
=======

Some of the tests are disabled because auto_commit cannot be tested in test mode. 
In future releases we will consider improving the tests so that all cases can be covered.
