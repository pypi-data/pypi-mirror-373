**MCP as a Judge** is a revolutionary Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that **transforms the developer-AI collaboration experience**. It acts as an intelligent gatekeeper for software development, preventing bad coding practices by using AI-powered evaluation and involving users in critical decisions when requirements are unclear or obstacles arise.

> **⚖️ Concept**: This project extends the **LLM-as-a-Judge** paradigm to software engineering workflows, where AI models evaluate and guide development decisions rather than just generating code.

## ⚖️ **Main Purpose: Improve Developer-AI Interface**

**The core mission is to enhance the interface between developers and AI coding assistants** by:

- 🛡️ **Preventing AI from making poor decisions** through intelligent evaluation
- 🤝 **Involving humans in critical choices** instead of AI making assumptions
- 🔍 **Enforcing research and best practices** before implementation
- ⚖️ **Creating a collaborative AI-human workflow** for better software quality

## **Vibe Coding doesn't have to be frustrating**

### **What It Enforces:**

- ✅ **Deep research** of existing solutions and best practices
- ✅ **Generic, reusable solutions** instead of quick fixes
- ✅ **User requirements alignment** in all implementations
- ✅ **Comprehensive planning** before coding begins
- ✅ **User involvement** in all critical decisions
- ✅ **Intelligent AI-human collaboration** with clear boundaries and responsibilities

## 🛠️ **Features**

### **🔍 Intelligent Code Evaluation**

- **LLM-powered analysis** using MCP [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling) capability
- **Software engineering best practices** enforcement
- **Security vulnerability detection**
- **Performance and maintainability assessment**

### **📋 Comprehensive Planning Review**

- **Architecture validation** against industry standards
- **Research depth analysis** to prevent reinventing solutions
- **Requirements alignment** verification
- **Implementation approach evaluation**

### **🤝 User-Driven Decision Making**

- **Obstacle resolution** through user involvement via MCP [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#elicitation)
- **Requirements clarification** when requests are unclear
- **No hidden fallbacks** - transparent decision making
- **Interactive problem solving** with real-time user input

### **🛠️ List of Tools**

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`get_workflow_guidance`** | Smart workflow analysis and tool recommendation |
| **`judge_coding_plan`** | Comprehensive plan evaluation with requirements alignment |
| **`judge_code_change`** | Code review with security and quality checks |
| **`raise_obstacle`** | User involvement when blockers arise |
| **`elicit_missing_requirements`** | Clarification of unclear requests |

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Requirements & Recommendations**

#### **MCP Client Prerequisites**

MCP as a Judge is heavily dependent on **MCP Sampling** and **MCP Elicitation** features for its core functionality:

- **[MCP Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#sampling)** - Required for AI-powered code evaluation and judgment
- **[MCP Elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#elicitation)** - Required for interactive user decision prompts

#### **System Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.13+** - Required for running the MCP server

#### **Supported AI Assistants**

| AI Assistant | Platform | MCP Support | Status | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Visual Studio Code | ✅ Full | **Recommended** | Complete MCP integration with tool calling |

**✅ Recommended Setup:** GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code for the best MCP as a Judge experience.


#### **💡 Recommendations**

- **Large Context Window Models**: 1M+ token size models are strongly preferred for optimal performance
- Models with larger context windows provide better code analysis and more comprehensive judgments

> **Note**: MCP servers communicate via stdio (standard input/output), not HTTP ports. No network configuration is needed.



## 🔧 **Visual Studio Code Configuration**

Configure MCP as a Judge in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot:

### **Method 1: Using uv (Recommended)**

1. **Install the package:**

   ```bash
   uv tool install mcp-as-a-judge
   ```

2. **Configure Visual Studio Code MCP settings:**

   Add this to your Visual Studio Code MCP configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "mcp-as-a-judge": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["tool", "run", "mcp-as-a-judge"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### **Method 2: Using Docker**

1. **Pull the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/hepivax/mcp-as-a-judge:latest
   ```

2. **Configure Visual Studio Code MCP settings:**

   Add this to your Visual Studio Code MCP configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "mcp-as-a-judge": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "ghcr.io/hepivax/mcp-as-a-judge:latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```


## 📖 **How It Works**

Once MCP as a Judge is configured in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot, it automatically guides your AI assistant through a structured software engineering workflow. The system operates transparently in the background, ensuring every development task follows best practices.

### **🔄 Automatic Workflow Enforcement**

**1. Intelligent Workflow Guidance**

- When you make any development request, the AI assistant automatically calls `get_workflow_guidance`
- This tool uses AI analysis to determine which validation steps are required for your specific task
- Provides smart recommendations on which tools to use next and in what order
- No manual intervention needed - the workflow starts automatically with intelligent guidance

**2. Planning & Design Phase**

- For any implementation task, the AI assistant must first help you create:
  - **Detailed coding plan** - Step-by-step implementation approach
  - **System design** - Architecture, components, and technical decisions
  - **Research findings** - Analysis of existing solutions and best practices
- Once complete, `judge_coding_plan` automatically evaluates the plan using MCP Sampling
- **AI-powered evaluation** checks for design quality, security, research thoroughness, and requirements alignment

**3. Code Implementation Review**

- After any code is written or modified, `judge_code_change` is automatically triggered
- **Mandatory code review** happens immediately after file creation/modification
- Uses MCP Sampling to evaluate code quality, security vulnerabilities, and best practices
- Ensures every code change meets professional standards

### **🤝 User Involvement When Needed**

**Obstacle Resolution**

- When the AI assistant encounters blockers or conflicting requirements, `raise_obstacle` automatically engages you
- Uses MCP Elicitation to present options and get your decision
- No hidden fallbacks - you're always involved in critical decisions

**Requirements Clarification**

- If your request lacks sufficient detail, `elicit_missing_requirements` automatically asks for clarification
- Uses MCP Elicitation to gather specific missing information
- Ensures implementation matches your actual needs

### **🎯 What to Expect**

- **Automatic guidance** - No need to explicitly ask the AI coding assistant to call tools
- **Comprehensive planning** - Every implementation starts with proper design and research
- **Quality enforcement** - All code changes are automatically reviewed against industry standards
- **User-driven decisions** - You're involved whenever your original request cannot be satisfied
- **Professional standards** - Consistent application of software engineering best practices

## 🔒 **Privacy & API Key Free**

### **🔑 No LLM API Key Required**

- All judgments are performed using **MCP Sampling** capability
- No need to configure or pay for external LLM API services
- Works directly with your MCP-compatible client's existing AI model

### **🛡️ Your Privacy Matters**

- The server runs **locally** on your machine
- **No data collection** - your code and conversations stay private
- **No external API calls** - everything happens within your local environment
- Complete control over your development workflow and sensitive information

3. **Manual releases**: Create a tag `v1.2.3` and push to trigger release workflow

```bash
# Example conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add new validation rule for async functions"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in server startup"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```
