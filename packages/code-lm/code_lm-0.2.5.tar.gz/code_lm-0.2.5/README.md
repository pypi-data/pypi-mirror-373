## Installation

### Method 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install code-lm
```

### Method 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Panagiotis897/lm-code.git
cd lm-code

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

---

## Setup

Before using LM Code, you need to set up your API keys for OpenRouter.

### Configure API Key

```bash
lmcode setup YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

This saves your API key in the configuration file located at `~/.config/gemini-code/config.yaml`.

## Usage

### Start an Interactive Session

```bash
# Start with the default model
lmcode

# Start with a specific model
lmcode --model qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct:free
```

### Manage Models

```bash
# Set a default model
lmcode set-default-model deepseek/deepseek-r1:free

# List all available models
lmcode list-models
```

---

## Supported Models

- **Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B**: `qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct:free`
- **Qwen QWQ 32B**: `qwen/qwq-32b:free`
- **DeepSeek R1**: `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`
- **Gemma 3 (27B Italian)**: `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental**: `google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free`

---

## Interactive Commands

During an interactive session, you can use these commands:

- **`/exit`**: Exit the session.
- **`/help`**: Display help information.

---

## How It Works

LM Code uses native tools to enhance your coding experience. For instance:

1. You ask: "What files are in the current directory?"
2. LM Code uses the `ls` tool to fetch directory contents.
3. The assistant formats and presents the response.

This seamless integration of tools and AI makes LM Code a powerful coding partner.
