## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping OrionAI safe for everyone.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by:

1. **Email**: Send details to aistudentlearn4@gmail.com
2. **Private Message**: Contact project maintainers directly
3. **Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private security advisory feature

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proposed Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix, please include them

## Response Process

### Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity and severity

### Our Commitment
When you report a vulnerability, we will:

1. **Respond promptly** to acknowledge your report
2. **Investigate thoroughly** to understand the issue
3. **Keep you informed** of our progress
4. **Credit you appropriately** (if desired) when we publish the fix
5. **Work with you** to ensure the issue is properly resolved

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Rotate keys regularly** and revoke unused ones
- **Limit API key permissions** to minimum required scope

#### Safe Configuration
```python
# Good: Use environment variables
import os
from orionai.python import AIPython

api_key = os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
ai = AIPython(provider='google', api_key=api_key)

# Bad: Hardcoded API keys
ai = AIPython(provider='google', api_key='your-actual-key-here')  # Don't do this!
```

#### Input Validation
- **Validate user inputs** before processing
- **Be cautious with file operations** on user-provided paths
- **Sanitize data** before saving or displaying

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Review dependencies** regularly for known vulnerabilities
- **Use type hints** to catch potential issues early
- **Implement proper error handling** to avoid information leakage
- **Follow secure coding practices** for file and network operations

#### Testing
- **Test with invalid inputs** to ensure proper error handling
- **Check for information leakage** in error messages
- **Validate all user-controlled inputs**
- **Test authentication and authorization** mechanisms

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM Provider APIs
- API keys provide access to external services
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse
- Error messages may contain sensitive information
- Network requests expose data to external services

### File Operations
- File paths should be validated to prevent directory traversal
- Temporary files should be properly cleaned up
- File permissions should be appropriately restrictive
- Large files should be processed efficiently to prevent DoS

### Code Execution
- Generated code is executed in the local environment
- Consider sandboxing for untrusted inputs
- Validate and sanitize any dynamic code generation
- Monitor resource usage to prevent resource exhaustion

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report received** and acknowledged
2. **Investigation** and fix development
3. **Testing** and validation of the fix
4. **Release** of patched version
5. **Public disclosure** with credit to reporter

### Public Disclosure Timeline
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 30-90 days after initial report
- **High/Medium vulnerabilities**: 90 days after initial report
- **Low vulnerabilities**: 180 days after initial report

## Security Updates

### Release Process
Security updates follow this process:

1. **Patch Development**: Fix is developed and tested
2. **Version Release**: New version is released with security fix
3. **Advisory Publication**: Security advisory is published
4. **User Notification**: Users are notified through multiple channels

### Update Notifications
Stay informed about security updates:

- **GitHub Releases**: Watch the repository for new releases
- **Security Advisories**: Enable GitHub security advisories
- **Package Managers**: Security updates through pip/conda

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we:

- **Acknowledge contributions** in release notes and documentation
- **Provide recognition** for responsible disclosure
- **Consider contributions** for maintainer roles

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Issues**: Use private reporting channels
- **General Questions**: Create a GitHub discussion
- **Documentation**: Refer to our security guidelines
