# Changelist-FOCI
Obtains the FOCI from a ChangeList.

## How It Works
The changelist information is loaded from a workspace file, and processed into Changelist Data objects.
The Changelist Data is then processed to obtain the FOCI (File Oriented Commit Information).

## Arguments
**Workspace Path:** `--workspace`
The Workspace path is an optional argument, which is used to load the workspace file contents.

If the `--workspace` argument is not provided, it is assumed that the current working directory is the project root directory.

**Changelist Name:** `--changelist`
The Changelist name is an optional argument, that is used to select which Changelist to obtain the FOCI for.

If the changelist name is not provided:
- The active changelist `(default = true)` will be the target of the operation.

**All Changes FOCI:** `-a` or `--all-changes`
An optional flag that overrides Changelist Name and prints out all Changelists with Changes.

**FOCI Comments:** `-c` or `--comments`
Insert the FOCI into the Changelist Data file comments, rather than printing.
- This argument is combined with the `--all-changes` argument. All Changelist Comments are updated every time.
- Disables the `--changelist` name selection argument.
- Works with both Workspace and Changelist data files.

## File Format Flags
**Full Path:** `--full-path`
The full path of the file is given in Line Subjects.
 - Includes the first slash of directories in the project root (removed by default). 

**File Extension:** `--no-file-ext` or `-x`
Remove the File Extension from File Names.

**File Name:** `--filename` or `-f`
Include only the File Name in Subject Lines.
 - Removes the whole path to the File.
 - May be combined with the File Extension flag.
