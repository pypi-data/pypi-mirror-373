        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
        information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
        warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their

        fullest extent possible.
        
        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
             for the public:

        interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
        consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the

             terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
             all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time
             individually chosen by them.
        
          m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

             the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.

                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
             only;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License

**`yunta`** provides several implementations of protein-protein interaction evaluation. In increasing computational cost:

- GPU-accelerated direct coupling analysis (DCA) (in Tensorflow and PyTorch)
- [RoseTTAFold](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)-2track via the `rf2t-micro` package
- [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) for protein-protein structure prediction

`yunta` has streamlined installation, a command-line interface, a Python API, and some 
resilience to GPU out-of-memory error though chunking of long sequences and CPU-fallback. 
It takes as input unpaired multiple-sequence alignments in A3M format (as generated by 
tools like [`hhblits`](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite)), and outputs a matrix of 
inter-residue contacts.

Rough timings for a pair of ~200 amino-acid proteins (_S. cerevisiae_ DHFR and WW domain-containing protein) on CPU:

- **DCA**: 5 seconds

- **RosettaFold-2track**: 10 seconds

<img src="docs/source/_static/P07807-P43582-rf2t.png" alt="" width="200">

- **AlphaFold2**: 1 hour

<img src="docs/source/_static/P07807-P43582-af2.png" alt="" width="200">

Note that these times will increase quadratically with the total length of the proteins.

## Installation

Obtaining and setting up `yunta` is easy.

```bash
$ pip install yunta
```

If you want to enable GPU, use

```bash
$ pip install yunta[cuda12]
```

If you want to use a local CUDA installation instead, use

```bash
$ pip install yunta[cuda12_local]
```

Using the embedded model requires using the [RoseTTAFold](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)-2track and AlphaFold2 weights. These are automatically downloaded, but by using `yunta` you agree that the trained weights for RoseTTAFold are made available for non-commercial use only under the terms of the [Rosetta-DL Software license](https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RoseTTAFold/Rosetta-DL_LICENSE.txt) and AlphaFold2's pretrained parameters fall under the [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

## Credit

`yunta` is a fork of [SpeedPPI](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.15.536993v1), which is itself inspired by [FoldDock](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28865-w). This method used AlphaFold2 to evaluate 65,484 protein-protein interactions from the human proteome in [Towards a structurally resolved human protein interaction network](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-022-00910-8).

The idea of using DCA, [RoseTTAFold](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)-2track, and [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) in a cascade of increasingly expensive and specific PPI detection methods has been explored in a series of papers from David Baker's lab:

- [Cong et al., Protein interaction networks revealed by proteome coevolution. _Science_, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw6718)
- [Humpreys et al., Computed structures of core eukaryotic protein complexes. _Science_, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm4805)
- [Humpreys et al., Protein interactions in human pathogens revealed through deep learning. _Nature Microbiology_, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01791-x)

`yunta` puts these algorithms in one place with easy installation, a command-line interface, and a Python API. It also enables inerspecies co-evolutionary analysis using
a built-in interspecies interaction mapping.

## Command-line usage 

You can always get more help by running

```bash
$ yunta --help
usage: yunta [-h] {dca-single,dca-many,rf2t-single,af2-single,af2-many} ...

Screening protein-protein interactions using DCA and AlphaFold2.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Sub-commands:
  {dca-single,dca-many,rf2t-single,af2-single,af2-many}
                        Use these commands to specify the tool you want to use.
    dca-single          Calculate DCA for one protein-protein interaction.
    dca-many            Calculate DCA between two sets of proteins, or all pairs in one set of proteins.
    rf2t-single         Calculate RF-2track contacts for between one protein and a series of others.
    af2-single          Model one protein-protein interaction.
    af2-many            Model all interactions between two sets of proteins, or all pairs in one set of proteins.
```

### Generating multiple-sequence alignments

All the algorithms depend on pre-computed multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs) between a protein of interest and as many other proteins as possible. This allows computations to be sped up by separating out this phase of the calculation. You can generate MSAs using a dedicated tool like [`hhblits`](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite), which will speed up the process by using pre-clustered datasbes like UniClust. We typically use a command like:

```bash
hhblits -e 0.01 -v 3 -d /path/to/UniClust-database -i input.fasta -oa3m output-msa.a3m -o /dev/null -cov 60 -n 3 -realign -realign_max 10000
```

In our experience, this can take 1-40 min depending on the complexity of the query. Check the [`hhsuite`](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) documentation for more details.

Once you have your MSAs, you can use the information contained within them using tools in `yunta` to calculate contact maps and predict structures of protein complexes with AlphaFold2.

### Calculating contact maps

Given two MSAs, `yunta` will calculate the contact map using DCA, RF2t, or AlphaFold2, and produce a summary table for each pair provided as input. 

Using DCA or RF2t will produce a table like this:

```bash
$ yunta dca-single test/inputs/DYR_YEAST.a3m -2 test/inputs/CAPZA_YEAST.a3m -o test/outputs/dca-single.tsv --apc
```

| ID | uniprot_id_1	| uniprot_id_2 | seq_len | chain_a_len	| chain_b_len	| msa1_depth	| msa2_depth	| msa_depth	| n_eff	| apc	| mean | median | maximum	| minimum |
| -- | ------------ | ------------ | ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------	| ----- | ---	| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| O13297-D6VTK4	| O13297 | D6VTK4 | 980	| 549	| 431	| 14246	| 1546 | 670	| 2	| False	| 0.01830857 | 0.014683756 | 0.07428725	| 2.284808e-06 |

If you also give the `--plot` option, then the contact maps for the entore complex and only the inter-chain contacts will be saved, along with CSV files containing the numerical values as matrix. For example,

```bash
$ yunta dca-single test/inputs/DYR_YEAST.a3m -2 test/inputs/CAPZA_YEAST.a3m -o test/outputs/dca-single.tsv --apc --plot test/outputs/DYR_YEAST-CAPZA_YEAST
```

`...`

### Predicting protein complex structures

`yunta` can also feed your MSAs into the AlphaFold2 model to predict structures of binary protein complexes.

```bash
$ yunta af2-single test/inputs/DYR_YEAST.a3m -2 test/inputs/CAPZA_YEAST.a3m -o test/outputs/af2-single
```

This will also generate a table


Using `--plot` will generate the contact maps as with the other commands.

```bash
$ yunta af2-single test/inputs/DYR_YEAST.a3m -2 test/inputs/CAPZA_YEAST.a3m -o test/outputs/af2-single --plot test/outputs/af2-single-plot
```

<img src="docs/source/_static/P07807-P43582-af2.interaction.png" alt="" width="350">


### Command-line tools

You can run 1-vs-many with the `*-single` commands. For example:

```bash
$ yunta dca-single --help
usage: yunta dca-single [-h] [--msa2 [MSA2 ...]] [--list-file] [--interspecies] [--output [OUTPUT]] [--plot PLOT] [--apc] [msa1]

positional arguments:
  msa1                  MSA file. Default: STDIN.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --msa2 [MSA2 ...], -2 [MSA2 ...]
                        Second MSA file(s). Default: if not provided, all pairwise from msa1.
  --list-file, -l       Treat inputs as plain-text list of MSA files, rather than MSA filenames. Default: treat as MSA filenames.
  --interspecies, -i    Whether the MSAs are from the same species. Default: Not inter-species.
  --output [OUTPUT], -o [OUTPUT]
                        Output filename. Default: STDOUT.
  --plot PLOT, -p PLOT  Directory for saving plots. Default: don't plot.
  --apc, -a             Whether to use APC correction in DCA. Default: don't apply correction.
```

If one MSA is provided, then homodimeric interactions are probed. For convenience, you can use the `--list-file` option to provide a single file +
containing a list of MSA files (one per line).

You can run many-vs-many with the `*-many` commands. For example:

```bash
$ yunta af2-many --help
usage: yunta af2-many [-h] [--msa2 [MSA2 ...]] [--list-file] [--interspecies] --output OUTPUT [--params PARAMS] [--recycles RECYCLES] [--plot PLOT] [msa1 ...]

positional arguments:
  msa1                  MSA file(s). Default: "<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdin>' mode='r' encoding='utf-8'>".

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --msa2 [MSA2 ...], -2 [MSA2 ...]
                        Second MSA file(s). Default: if not provided, all pairwise from msa1.
  --list-file, -l       Treat inputs as plain-text list of MSA files, rather than MSA filenames. Default: treat as MSA filenames.
  --interspecies, -i    Whether the MSAs are from the same species. Default: Not inter-species.
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Output directory. Required.
  --params PARAMS, -w PARAMS
                        Path to AlphaFold2 params file (.npz).
  --recycles RECYCLES, -x RECYCLES
                        Maximum number of recyles through the model. Default: "10".
  --plot PLOT, -p PLOT  Directory for saving plots. Default: don't plot.
```

## Python API

We provide an API for using MSAs in your own programs. 

```python
>>> from yunta.structs.msa import *
>>> msa = MSA.from_file("my-msa-file.a3m")
>>> msa.neff()
6
```

In case you prefer, you can also import a PyTorch implementation of DCA (adapted from the Tensorflow of [Humpreys, _Science_, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm4805)).

```python
>>> from yunta.dca_torch import calculate_dca
>>> from yunta.structs.msa import *
>>> paired_msa = PairedMSA.from_file("my-msa-file1.a3m", "my-msa-file2.a3m")
>>> calculate_dca(paired_msa.sequence_token_ids, apc=True, gpu=False)
```

(More documentation coming soon!)

## ... if you want to scale up

While the `*-many` commands can deal with processing multiple possible protein-protein interactions, if you want to screen more than a few and have access to a HPC cluster then using our [`nf-ggi` Nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/scbirlab/nf-ggi) will be more efficient, and can generate the MSAs for you.
