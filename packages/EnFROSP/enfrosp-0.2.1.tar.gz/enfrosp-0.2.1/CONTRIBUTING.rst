Commit Changes
--------------

How to
~~~~~~

1. Fork the `enfrosp` repo on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@git.gfz-potsdam.de:EnMAP/GFZ_Tools_EnMAP_BOX/enfrosp.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv enfrosp
    $ cd enfrosp/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint
    $ python -m unittest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a merge request through the GitLab website.

   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Check
   https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/EnMAP/GFZ_Tools_EnMAP_BOX/enfrosp/-/merge_requests
