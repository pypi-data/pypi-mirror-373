    "# Differentiation of continuous functions using the FFT\n",

    "In this notebook, we use the FFTArray to compute the derivatives of two periodic test functions. Afterwards we will evaluate these functions on a one-dimensional grid and compare the results to their analytic counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we briefly recall the definitions for differentiation via Fourier transform from (__[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Differentiation)__):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $g(x)$ with position $x {\\in} {\\mathbb{R}}$ is an absolutely continuous differentiable function, and both $g$ and its derivative $gâ€²$ are integrable. Then, the Fourier transform of the derivative is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\frac{d}{dx} g(x)\\right\\} = i 2\\pi f \\ \\hat{g}(f).\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Note, that the differential operator transformed into a multiplication with the frequencies $f {\\in} {\\mathbb{R}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This in principle allows to compute the derivative of any function $g(x)$ by first computing its Fourier transformation and then inversely transforming the product: \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{d^n}{d^n x} g(x) = \\mathcal{F^{-1}}{ \\left( \\mathcal{F}{ \\left( \\frac{d^n}{d^n x} g(x) \\right)} \\right)}  = \\mathcal{F^{-1}}{ \\left( (i 2\\pi f)^n \\ \\hat{g}(f) \\right)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, finding the analytic expressions for the Fourier transform and its inverse by computing double integrals is often not straightforward or even impossible.\n",
    "Instead, numerically sampling $g(x)$ allows us to apply the FFT to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> To avoid errors when evaluating the above equations numerically due to sampling on a finite grid, we require that $g(x) \\rightarrow 0$ sufficiently fast as $x$ approaches the grid boundaries. This can be ensured, for example, via sufficiently large grids. Additionally the sampling step size is small enough to properly represent all frequencies contained in the function."
