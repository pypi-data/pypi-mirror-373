"""
contexts.py

Defines abstract context interfaces for controllers, event handlers,
and routines. These contexts provide structured access to logging,
shared state, and communication channels, making it clear which
elements are read-only and which are writable.

Design notes:
    - All contexts separate read-only and writable elements.
    - Logging is always available.
    - Shared state and message access are structured to prevent
      unintended interference.
