        """Get device inventory from test architecture in an architecture-agnostic way.

        This method implements the contract pattern for SSH-based test architectures.
        It dynamically discovers which devices to test without knowing anything about
        the specific architecture (SD-WAN, NXOS, IOSXE, etc.).

        How it works:
        1. Takes D2D test files (already filtered to only contain tests from /d2d/ directory)
        2. Imports the first test file to find the SSH base class
        3. Calls the base class's get_ssh_device_inventory() method
        4. Returns whatever the architecture provides - no modifications

        Why we should only need the first test file:
        - All D2D tests within an architecture are likely to share the same SSH base class
        - E.g., all SD-WAN D2D tests inherit from SDWANTestBase
        - E.g., future NXOS D2D tests would inherit from NXOSTestBase
        - So any D2D test file gives us access to the inventory method

        Architecture "contract":
        Every SSH-based test architecture MUST provide a base class that:
        - Inherits from SSHTestBase (provided by nac-test)
        - Implements get_ssh_device_inventory(data_model) class method
        - Returns a list of dicts with REQUIRED fields: hostname, host, os, username, password
        - Optional fields: type, platform (for PyATS/Unicon compatibility)
        #TODO: Prob need to think about "type" and "platform" b/c PyATS/Unicon is picky.

        Example implementations:
        - nac-sdwan: SDWANTestBase parses test_inventory.yaml + sites data
        - future nac-nxos: NXOSTestBase might parse a different YAML structure
        - future nac-iosxe: IOSXETestBase might scan JSON files in data/devices/

        The orchestrator doesn't care HOW each architecture finds its devices,
        it just calls the contract method and uses what it gets back.

        Args:
            test_files: List of D2D test files (we'll use the first one)

        Returns:
            List of device dictionaries with connection information

                # but Python doesn't know where to find the 'tests' package when `nac-test` is run.
                #
                # In the API test flow, the orchestrator sets up PYTHONPATH before discovery,
                # but for D2D tests, DeviceInventoryDiscovery runs BEFORE any path setup.

                #
                # How this works:

                # 2. Add its parent directory to sys.path
                # 3. This allows Python to resolve "from tests.something import ..."
                #
                # Example:
                # - Test file: /home/user/nac-sdwan-terraform/tests/d2d/bgp_peers.py
                # - Find 'tests' dir: /home/user/nac-sdwan-terraform/tests
                # - Add to sys.path: /home/user/nac-sdwan-terraform
