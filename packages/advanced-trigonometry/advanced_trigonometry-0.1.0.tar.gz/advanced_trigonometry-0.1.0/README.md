# Advanced Trigonometry Library

A Python library providing a comprehensive set of trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, and advanced trigonometric functions with support for different angle units and complex numbers.

## Features

- Core trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arccos, arctan)
- Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh) and their inverses (asinh, acosh, atanh)
- Advanced functions (sec, csc, cot) and their hyperbolic counterparts (sech, csch, coth)
- Support for radians, degrees, and gradians
- Handles complex number inputs
- Comprehensive documentation
- Robust test suite

## Installation

Currently, this library is not available on PyPI. To use it, you can copy the code directly into your project or import it as a local module.

Assuming the code is in a file named `trigonometry.py`, you can import it like this:
