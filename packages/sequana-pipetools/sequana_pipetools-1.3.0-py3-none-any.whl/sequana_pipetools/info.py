This script prepares the pipeline sequana_{name}. It stores the pipeline and its
configuration file in the requested working directory ({name} by default).
Please check out the documentation carefully. In case of issues, please report
on https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues or https://github.com/sequana/{name}/issues

Pipelines can be run locally or on a SLURM cluster. If no slurm commands are
found, the pipeline is run in 'local' mode, otherwise in 'slurm' mode.

A working directory called {name} is created with a {name}.sh script to be executed.
