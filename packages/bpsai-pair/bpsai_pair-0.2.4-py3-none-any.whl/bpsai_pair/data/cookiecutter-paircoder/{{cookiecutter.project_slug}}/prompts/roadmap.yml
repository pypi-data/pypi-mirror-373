  Convert the accepted plan into two files:
  1) /context/development.md — engineering tasks, tests, risks with Phase 1/2/3 breakdown and acceptance criteria; coverage target {{ coverage_target }}.
  2) /context/agents.md — update Operating Modes/Prompts if needed.
  Ensure milestones are measurable. Keep diffs small and reversible.
