"""Repository metadata and structure management.

This module handles repository-specific operations including reference resolution,
file tree retrieval, and metadata management. It provides an abstraction layer
over GitHub's Git API for working with repository structure.

Key Features:
    - Reference resolution (branches, tags, commits)
    - Repository file tree retrieval
    - Branch and tag enumeration
    - Commit SHA validation and lookup
    - Repository metadata management

Typical Usage:
    >>> from gitbridge.repository_manager import RepositoryManager
    >>> from gitbridge.api_client import GitHubAPIClient
    >>>
    >>> client = GitHubAPIClient("owner", "repo", token="...")
    >>> repo_mgr = RepositoryManager(client)
    >>>
    >>> # Resolve reference to commit SHA
    >>> sha = repo_mgr.resolve_ref("main")
    >>>
    >>> # Get file tree for a reference
    >>> tree = repo_mgr.get_repository_tree("main")

class RepositoryManager:
    """Manages repository metadata and structure operations.

    This class provides high-level operations for working with GitHub repository
    structure, including reference resolution, file tree retrieval, and metadata
    management. It abstracts the complexity of GitHub's Git API.

    Attributes:
        client (GitHubAPIClient): Low-level API client for HTTP operations
        owner (str): Repository owner name (from client)
        repo (str): Repository name (from client)

    DOCDEV-NOTE: Component Architecture - Repository Management Layer
        This class was extracted from the monolithic GitHubAPISync to handle all
        repository-specific operations. It provides a clean abstraction over
        GitHub's Git API, handling the complexity of reference resolution and
        tree traversal.

    DOCDEV-NOTE: Design Decisions
        - Separation of Concerns: Repository logic separate from sync logic
        - Efficient Tree Retrieval: Uses Trees API instead of recursive Contents API
        - Smart Reference Resolution: Handles branches, tags, and commits uniformly
        - Caching Ready: Structure supports future tree caching implementation

    DOCDEV-TODO: Future Enhancements
        - Add tree caching to reduce API calls
        - Implement sparse checkout patterns
        - Support for submodules
        - Parallel tree fetching for large repositories
