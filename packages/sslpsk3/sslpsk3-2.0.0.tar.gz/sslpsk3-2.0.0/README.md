# sslpsk3

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sslpsk3.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sslpsk3)

This module adds TLS-PSK support to the `ssl` package in Python 3.7+.

## Installation

```pip install sslpsk3```

`pip` builds from source for Linux and Mac OSX, so a C compiler, the Python
development headers, and the OpenSSL development headers are required. For
Microsoft Windows, pre-built binaries are available so there are no such
prerequisites.

## Usage

The old method of using `ssl.wrap_socket(...)` is deprecated and not available in Python 3.12+, so the recommended way
is `SSLContext`.

This library introduces a drop-in replacement `SSLPSKContext` class which supports TLS-PSK.

On Python 3.13 and newer, it uses the native implementation; on older versions, a custom implementation based on OpenSSL
is used.

Server code example:

```py
import ssl
from sslpsk3 import SSLPSKContext

context = SSLPSKContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
context.maximum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_2
context.set_ciphers("PSK")
context.set_psk_server_callback(lambda identity: b"abcdef", identity_hint="server_hint")
sock = context.wrap_socket(...)
```

Client code example:

```py
import ssl
from sslpsk3 import SSLPSKContext

context = SSLPSKContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
context.check_hostname = False
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
context.maximum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_2
context.set_ciphers("PSK")
context.set_psk_client_callback(lambda hint: ("client_identity", b"abcdef"))
sock = context.wrap_socket(...)
```

For more information refer
to [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_psk_client_callback) as
well as [the `test_context_simple.py` test file](tests/test_context_simple.py).

That being said, this library also still contains a backported version of `wrap_context()`, which works the same way as
in previous versions of `sslpsk`/`sslpsk2`/`sslpsk3`. If possible, please migrate to `SSLPSKContext` anyway.

## Backstory

There were two published versions on PyPI, both without Python 3.11 support.

Additionally, for whatever reason, the Windows build of `sslpsk2` for Python 3.10 has been linked against OpenSSL 3,
while Python 3.10 on Windows uses OpenSSL 1.1.1, which causes run-time crashes (Python started using OpenSSL 3 in
3.11.5).

This fork aims to fix the incompatibility between Python and OpenSSL versions.
