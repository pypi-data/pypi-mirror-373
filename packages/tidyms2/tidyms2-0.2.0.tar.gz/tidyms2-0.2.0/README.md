Tools to process mass spectrometry data.

TidyMS2 is an upgraded version from [TidyMS](https://github.com/griquelme/tidyms), built from scratch and designed
to work with Python latest practices.

TidyMS2 offers a highly customizable framework for processing mass spectrometry datasets:

**For processing MS datasets:**

- tools for processing LC-MS datasets: build pipelines to define how to process your data and TidyMS manages the rest.
- optimized for scalability: efficiently processes datasets with thousands of samples while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.
- test your pipelines with dataset simulation utilities
- data persistence for intermediate data and results 
- result visualization

**For creating new processing algorithms**

- a highly extensive data model for expressing features
- a data flow model that validates and manages data through your data pipeline. 

Installation
------------

> [!WARNING]
> TidyMS2 is currently in early development, and the API may be subject to breaking changes until the 1.0
> release. Please be aware that future updates may alter functionality or behavior. We recommend keeping
