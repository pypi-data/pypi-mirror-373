## Optimized Dependencies Security Assessment

### Core Dependencies ✅
- All core dependencies use version ranges with upper bounds
- FastAPI, Pydantic, and Semantic Kernel are pinned to secure versions
- No wildcard versions or dangerous patterns detected

### ML Dependencies 🟡
- JAX/NumPyro ecosystem generally secure but rapidly evolving
- Monitor for updates regularly due to performance/security fixes
- Consider pinning JAX versions more tightly in production

### Azure Dependencies ⚠️
- Azure SDKs have had security issues historically
- Using pre-release versions (b1) may have undiscovered vulnerabilities
- Monitor Azure security advisories closely

### Data Dependencies ✅  
- Redis and SQL dependencies are well-maintained
- Versions chosen avoid known vulnerabilities
- Database connections should use TLS in production

## Action Items

1. **Immediate:** Install `pip-audit` and `safety` for automated scanning
2. **Short-term:** Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline  
3. **Medium-term:** Implement dependency update automation
4. **Long-term:** Consider migration to more secure dependency management (Poetry)

## Overall Security Score: B+ (Good)

The optimized dependency configuration addresses most security concerns through:
- Proper version constraints with upper bounds
- Removal of unused/risky dependencies  
- Separation of dev/prod dependencies
- Use of stable, well-maintained packages

Key areas for improvement:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Regular dependency updates
- Enhanced monitoring for Azure SDK security issues
