Description: This package provides a WSGI publisher concept using zope components including
        transactions, application error handling, traverser, pages views and offers
        jsonrpc without a ZODB. The package offers a wsgi application which kicks in
        the known zope publication concept. The publication concept can get used with
        gevent or similar async frameworks. It's up to you how you store persistent
        items. Probably the container, item and traversal pattern in m01.mongo is a
        good choice for this.

        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: fix string encoding issues. Python 3 is work in progress and requires
          a pywsgi version which doesn't only require str.
        
        
        0.9.3 (2025-06-04)
        ------------------
        
        - python 2.7 migration
        
        - removed z3c.jsonrpc dependency
        
        - implemented Debugger concept
        
        
        0.9.2 (2025-05-27)
        ------------------
        
        - requirements update: zope.interface >= 5.5.2
        
        
        0.9.1 (2021-12-04)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: allow to use Basic Authentication header credentias in JSONRPC proxy.
        
        - feature: Suport username and password in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for setup
          Authentication Basic header.
        
        - feature: Support Bearer token in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for Authentication
          Bearer header.
        
        
        0.9.0 (2017-09-18)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: implemented ZODB support. Now it's possible to use p01.publisher
          and use a ZODB not only a WSGI application.
        
        - renamed p01.publisher.traversers to p01.publisher.traverser
        
        - enable threadSiteSubscriber and clearThreadSiteSubscriber event subscriber
          handler
        
        
        0.8.0 (2017-01-24)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: transaction >= 2.0.3 uses unicode for transaction note. See comment
          in transaction CHANGES.txt. The user and description fields must now be set
          with text (unicode) data. Previously, if bytes were provided, theyâ€™d be
          decoded as ASCII. It was decided that this would lead to bugs that were hard
          to test for.
        
        
        0.7.0 (2016-09-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: re-implemented json reader and writer concept. Use reader and writer
          from p01.json.api
        
        - bugfix: support PATH_INFO in JSONRPCTestTransport used by the test method
          getJSONRPCTestProxy. This ensures that we traverse to the related context
          for calling the json-rpc method.
        
        - feature: use JSONRPCProxy from p01.json as json-rpc test proxy
        
        - sort response header before return, except Status and X-Powered-By
        
        
        0.6.0 (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: added application/json support. The new request json method returns
          the json formated data given from a request with content type applicaton/json.
          The raw content is stored in the request raw property if such json content
          is given.
        
        - added OPTIONS to allwed request methods. This allows to handle cross origin
          request given from android phones during development. Note, you ned to
          register a view for handle such requests. We just added the OPTIONS as a
          general allowed request method.
        
        - feature: use new testbrowser concept based on zope.testbrowser >= 5.0.0.
          This new testbrowser concept uses a wsgi application and is based on webtest.
          Currently we use p01.testbrowser which is a clone of zope.testbrowser because
          there is no zope.testbrowser release yet.
        
        - feature: implemented simple JSONRPCTestProxy based on wsgi app. This new
          test json rpc proxy uses the wsgi application publisher for process a
          request.
        
        - backport zope.publisher publication factory lookup. Improve the publication
          factory lookup by falling back to a more generic registration if the specific
          factory chooses not to handle the request after all
        
        
        0.5.0 (2014-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - initial release
