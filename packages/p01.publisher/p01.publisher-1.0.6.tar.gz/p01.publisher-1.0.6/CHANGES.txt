1.0.0 (2025-06-12)

------------------

------------------

- bugfix: allow to use Basic Authentication header credentias in JSONRPC proxy.

- feature: Suport username and password in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for setup
  Authentication Basic header.

- feature: Support Bearer token in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for Authentication
  Bearer header.


0.9.0 (2017-09-18)
------------------

- feature: implemented ZODB support. Now it's possible to use p01.publisher
  and use a ZODB not only a WSGI application.

- renamed p01.publisher.traversers to p01.publisher.traverser

- enable threadSiteSubscriber and clearThreadSiteSubscriber event subscriber
  handler


0.8.0 (2017-01-24)
------------------

- bugfix: transaction >= 2.0.3 uses unicode for transaction note. See comment
  in transaction CHANGES.txt. The user and description fields must now be set
  with text (unicode) data. Previously, if bytes were provided, theyâ€™d be
  decoded as ASCII. It was decided that this would lead to bugs that were hard
  to test for.


0.7.0 (2016-09-19)
------------------

- feature: re-implemented json reader and writer concept. Use reader and writer
  from p01.json.api

- bugfix: support PATH_INFO in JSONRPCTestTransport used by the test method
  getJSONRPCTestProxy. This ensures that we traverse to the related context
  for calling the json-rpc method.

- feature: use JSONRPCProxy from p01.json as json-rpc test proxy

- sort response header before return, except Status and X-Powered-By


0.6.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- feature: added application/json support. The new request json method returns
  the json formated data given from a request with content type applicaton/json.
  The raw content is stored in the request raw property if such json content
  is given.

- added OPTIONS to allwed request methods. This allows to handle cross origin
  request given from android phones during development. Note, you ned to
  register a view for handle such requests. We just added the OPTIONS as a
  general allowed request method.

- feature: use new testbrowser concept based on zope.testbrowser >= 5.0.0.
  This new testbrowser concept uses a wsgi application and is based on webtest.
  Currently we use p01.testbrowser which is a clone of zope.testbrowser because
  there is no zope.testbrowser release yet.

- feature: implemented simple JSONRPCTestProxy based on wsgi app. This new
  test json rpc proxy uses the wsgi application publisher for process a
  request.

- backport zope.publisher publication factory lookup. Improve the publication
  factory lookup by falling back to a more generic registration if the specific
  factory chooses not to handle the request after all


0.5.0 (2014-03-24)
------------------

- initial release
