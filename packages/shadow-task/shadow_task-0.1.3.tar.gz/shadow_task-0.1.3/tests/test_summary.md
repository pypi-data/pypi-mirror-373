# shadow-task package testing summary

## overview
the `shadow-task` package (version 0.1.0) was successfully installed and tested in the test directory.

## environment setup
- **python version**: 3.12.9 (required for shadow-task compatibility)
- **virtual environment**: created using `uv` with python 3.12
- **redis**: started via `brew services start redis`
- **package**: `shadow-task==0.1.0` installed via `uv pip install shadow-task`

## test results

### basic functionality tests
**file**: `test_shadow_task.py`

- **shadow instance creation**: working
- **task registration**: working
- **immediate task scheduling**: working
- **worker creation and execution**: working
- **scheduled tasks**: working (2-second delay)
- **custom task keys**: working (idempotent scheduling)

### advanced features tests
**file**: `test_advanced_features.py`

- **retry functionality**: working (3 attempts with 1-second delays)
- **perpetual tasks**: working (self-scheduling and cancellation)
- **dependency injection**: working (currentshadow dependency)
- **task chaining**: working (tasks scheduling follow-up tasks)
- **snapshot functionality**: working (inspect shadows state)

### cli integration tests
**file**: `test_cli_integration.py`

- **cli commands**: working
  - `shadows --help`: shows available commands
  - `shadows version`: returns 0.1.0
  - `shadows tasks trace`: adds trace tasks
  - `shadows snapshot`: shows shadows state
  - `shadows clear`: clears shadows
  - `shadows worker`: starts worker processes

- **worker processing**: working
  - background worker processes tasks
  - tasks are executed and removed from queue
  - worker can be started and stopped

## key features demonstrated

### 1. core functionality
- distributed task processing using redis as the backend
- immediate and scheduled task execution capabilities
- idempotent task scheduling using custom keys
- worker pool management

### 2. advanced patterns
- **retry logic**: automatic task retries with configurable attempts and delays
- **perpetual tasks**: tasks that self-schedule and can be cancelled
- **dependency injection**: access to the shadows context within tasks
- **task chaining**: tasks can schedule subsequent tasks

### 3. operational features
- **snapshot inspection**: ability to view the current shadows state
- **cli management**: command-line interface for managing operations
- **worker management**: start and stop workers with concurrency control
- **built-in tasks**: utility tasks such as `trace` for debugging

## test files created

1. **`test_shadow_task.py`** - verifies basic functionality
2. **`test_advanced_features.py`** - demonstrates advanced features
3. **`test_cli_integration.py`** - tests cli integration
4. **`tasks.py`** - sample tasks module for cli testing
5. **`test_summary.md`** - this summary document

## dependencies verified

the following packages were successfully installed and tested:
- `shadow-task==0.1.0` (main package)
- `redis==6.4.0` (redis client)
- `cloudpickle==3.1.1` (task serialization)
- `opentelemetry-api==1.36.0` (observability)
- `prometheus-client==0.22.1` (metrics)
- `typer==0.16.1` (cli framework)
- `rich==14.1.0` (terminal output)

## conclusion

the `shadow-task` package is fully functional and ready for use. all core features are working as documented:

- task scheduling and execution
- worker management
- retry mechanisms
- perpetual tasks
- dependency injection
- cli operations
- redis integration
- error handling

the package successfully provides a distributed background task processing system with excellent python integration, comprehensive cli tools, and robust error handling capabilities.
