# chaos testing suite

this directory contains a chaos and load testing suite that verifies `shadows` under real-world conditions. the suite introduces controlled disorder to test system resilience and reliability.

## test modes

- **ci mode**: quick tests that complete in under 2 minutes, suitable for continuous integration pipelines
- **performance mode**: extended duration tests for thorough performance analysis and stress testing

## key features

- self-contained test environment
- reproducible test scenarios 
- verifiable results and metrics
- controlled chaos injection
- load pattern simulation

the suite helps ensure `shadows` maintains order and reliability even under chaotic conditions.
