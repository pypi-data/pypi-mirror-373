## Installation
You have options.

### Install from pypi
```bash
pip install BenchMatcha
```

### Clone the repository

cd BenchMatcha
pip install .
```

### Pip install directly from github.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Spill-Tea/BenchMatcha@main
```

## Development

BenchMatcha is currently in the planning stages of development. This means the project
is not ready for production use, and may be prone to change api without much notice.


## For Developers
After cloning the repository, create a new virtual environment and run the following
commands:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Running unit tests locally is straightforward with tox. Make sure
you have all python versions available required for your project
The `p` flag is not required, but it runs tox environments in parallel.
```bash
tox -p
```
Be sure to run tox before creating a pull request.
