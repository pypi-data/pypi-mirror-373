Birthday Paradox Computations
================================

This module is imported with::

    import toy_crypto.birthday

.. currentmodule:: toy_crypto.birthday

The classic :wikipedia:`Birthday problem` example is
to estimate the number of individuals
(whose birthdays are uniformly distributed among 365 days of the year)
for there to be at least a 0.5 probability of there being at least one pair of individuals who share the same birthday.

The function that returns a propbably is named :func:`P`,
and the one that returns a quantile is named :func:`Q`.
This follows the R conventions
[:cite:label:`RProject`]
as reflected in R's ``qbirthday`` and ``pbirthday`` functions.

.. testcode::

    from toy_crypto import birthday

    computed_n = birthday.Q(0.5, 367)
    print(computed_n)

.. testoutput::

    23
        
Birthday computations are useful for computing collision probabilites.
Suppose you had a hash function (truncated to ) returning 32 bit hashes
and you wished to know the probability of a collision if you hashed ten thousand items.

.. testcode::

    from toy_crypto import birthday
    from math import isclose

    n = 10_000
    c = 2 ** 32

    p = birthday.P(n, c)
    assert isclose(p,  0.011574013876)

Implementation ported from R
------------------------------

It was not a simple matter for me to find or construct an algorithm that 
produces reasonable approximations in a reasonably efficient way for the
ranges of numbers I wished to consider.
Eventually I found the solution used by :cite:t:`RProject`
in `R's birthday.R source <https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/stats/R/birthday.R>`__, which credits :cite:t:`DiaconisMosteller1989`.

My port of that implementation to Python only changes the conditions underwhich 
the approximate method is used along with some internal variable naming and commenting to help me better understand the algorithm and its implementation.
