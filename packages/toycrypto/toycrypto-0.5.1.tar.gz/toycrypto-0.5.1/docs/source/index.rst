Toy cryptographic functions and utilities
==========================================

This is a collection of utilities that can be used for illustrating or
exploring some cryptographic concepts.
Although it includes implementations of some cryptographic algorithms,
these are **not secure** implementations.

Note that if you need to do cryptography in Python,
I recommend pyca_ or PyNaCl_.
If you want tools to explore the algebraic and number theoretic constructs used in cryptography,
look at SageMath_ or sympy_.
