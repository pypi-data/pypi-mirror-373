    Notes
    -----

    Main graphics and rendering context, as well as the base `API` implementation
    for processing "core". Use this class if you need to draw into an off-screen
    graphics buffer. A Py5Graphics object can be constructed with the
    `create_graphics()` function. The `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` and
    `Py5Graphics.end_draw()` methods (see example) are necessary to set up the
    buffer and to finalize it. The fields and methods for this class are extensive.

    It is critically important that calls to this object's drawing methods are only
    used between `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` and `Py5Graphics.end_draw()`. Forgetting
    to call `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` will likely result in an ugly and unhelpful
    Java exception.

    To create a new graphics context, use the `create_graphics()` function. Do not
    use the syntax `Py5Graphics()`."""

        After using `create_shape()`, stroke and fill color can be set by calling
        methods like `Py5Shape.set_fill()` and `Py5Shape.set_stroke()`, as seen in the

        Creates colors for storing in variables of the `color` datatype (a 32 bit
        integer). The parameters are interpreted as `RGB` or `HSB` values depending on
        the current `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default mode is `RGB` values from 0
        to 255 and, therefore, `color(255, 204, 0)` will return a bright yellow color
        (see the first example).

        Note that if only one value is provided to `color()`, it will be interpreted as
        a grayscale value. Add a second value, and it will be used for alpha
        transparency. When three values are specified, they are interpreted as either
        `RGB` or `HSB` values. Adding a fourth value applies alpha transparency.

        Note that when using hexadecimal notation, it is not necessary to use `color()`,

        Creates colors for storing in variables of the `color` datatype (a 32 bit
        integer). The parameters are interpreted as `RGB` or `HSB` values depending on
        the current `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default mode is `RGB` values from 0
        to 255 and, therefore, `color(255, 204, 0)` will return a bright yellow color
        (see the first example).

        Note that if only one value is provided to `color()`, it will be interpreted as
        a grayscale value. Add a second value, and it will be used for alpha
        transparency. When three values are specified, they are interpreted as either
        `RGB` or `HSB` values. Adding a fourth value applies alpha transparency.

        Note that when using hexadecimal notation, it is not necessary to use `color()`,
        as in: `c = 0x006699`

        the current `color_mode()`. The default mode is `RGB` values from 0 to 255 and,
        therefore, `color(255, 204, 0)` will return a bright yellow color (see the first

        Note that if only one value is provided to `color()`, it will be interpreted as
        a grayscale value. Add a second value, and it will be used for alpha
        transparency. When three values are specified, they are interpreted as either
        `RGB` or `HSB` values. Adding a fourth value applies alpha transparency.

        Note that you can also use hexadecimal notation and web color notation to
        specify colors, as in `c = 0xFFDDCC33` or `c = "#DDCC33FF"` in place of `c =
        color(221, 204, 51, 255)`. Additionally, the `color()` method can accept both
        color notations as a parameter.

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "`0x`" before the values
        (e.g., `0xFFCCFFAA`). The hexadecimal value must be specified with eight
        characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values."""

        The `alpha()` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
        technique called bit shifting. When working in `color_mode(RGB, 255)`, you can
        achieve the same results as `alpha()` but with greater speed by using the right
        shift operator (`>>`) with a bit mask. For example, `alpha(c)` and `c >> 24 &
        0xFF` both extract the alpha value from a color variable `c` but the later is
        faster.

        Parameters
        ----------

        gray: float
            number specifying value between white and black

        rgb: int
            any value of the color datatype

        v1: float
            red or hue value (depending on current color mode)

        v2: float
            green or saturation value (depending on current color mode)

        v3: float
            blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the ambient reflectance for shapes drawn to the screen. This is combined
        with the ambient light component of the environment. The color components set
        through the parameters define the reflectance. For example in the default color
        mode, setting `ambient(255, 127, 0)`, would cause all the red light to reflect
        and half of the green light to reflect. Use in combination with
        `Py5Graphics.emissive()`, `Py5Graphics.specular()`, and
        `Py5Graphics.shininess()` to set the material properties of shapes.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.
        "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online "All About Colors" Python
        Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

        This method is the same as `ambient()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To
        see example code for how it can be used, see `ambient()`.

        Draws an arc to the screen. Arcs are drawn along the outer edge of an ellipse
        defined by the `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` parameters. The origin of the arc's
        ellipse may be changed with the `Py5Graphics.ellipse_mode()` function. Use the
        `start` and `stop` parameters to specify the angles (in radians) at which to
        draw the arc. The start/stop values must be in clockwise order.

        There are three ways to draw an arc; the rendering technique used is defined by
        the optional seventh parameter. The three options, depicted in the examples, are
        `PIE`, `OPEN`, and `CHORD`. The default mode is the `OPEN` stroke with a `PIE`
        fill.

        In some cases, the `arc()` function isn't accurate enough for smooth drawing.
        For example, the shape may jitter on screen when rotating slowly. If you're
        having an issue with how arcs are rendered, you'll need to draw the arc yourself
        with `Py5Graphics.begin_shape()` & `Py5Graphics.end_shape()` or a `Py5Shape`.

        This method is the same as `arc()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see

            Py5Image to set as background (must be same size as the Sketch window)

        rgb: int
            any value of the color datatype

        v1: float
            red or hue value (depending on the current color mode)

        v2: float
            green or saturation value (depending on the current color mode)

        v3: float
            blue or brightness value (depending on the current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        The `background()` function sets the color used for the background of the
        `Py5Graphics` object. The default background is 100% transparent.

        An image can also be used as the background, although the image's width and
        height must match that of the `Py5Graphics` object. Images used with
        `background()` will ignore the current `Py5Graphics.tint()` setting. To resize
        an image to the size of the `Py5Graphics` object, use `image.resize(width,
        height)`.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.
        "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online "All About Colors" Python
        Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

        Notes
        -----

        The `begin_camera()` and `Py5Graphics.end_camera()` functions enable advanced
        customization of the camera space. The functions are useful if you want to more
        control over camera movement, however for most users, the `Py5Graphics.camera()`
        function will be sufficient. The camera functions will replace any
        transformations (such as `Py5Graphics.rotate()` or `Py5Graphics.translate()`)
        that occur before them, but they will not automatically replace the camera
        transform itself. For this reason, camera functions should be placed right after
        the call to `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` (so that transformations happen
        afterwards), and the `Py5Graphics.camera()` function can be used after
        `begin_camera()` if you want to reset the camera before applying
        transformations.

        This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as
        `Py5Graphics.translate()`, `Py5Graphics.rotate()`, `Py5Graphics.apply_matrix()`
        and `Py5Graphics.reset_matrix()` affect the camera. `begin_camera()` should
        always be used with a following `Py5Graphics.end_camera()` and pairs of
        `begin_camera()` and `Py5Graphics.end_camera()` cannot be nested.

        This method can be used as a context manager to ensure that

        -----

        Use the `begin_contour()` and `Py5Graphics.end_contour()` methods to create

        `begin_contour()` method begins recording vertices for the shape and

        shape must "wind" in the opposite direction from the exterior shape. First draw
        vertices for the exterior shape in clockwise order, then for internal shapes,
        draw vertices counterclockwise.

        These methods can only be used within a `Py5Graphics.begin_shape()` &

        Notes
        -----

        To create vectors from 3D data, use the `begin_raw()` and
        `Py5Graphics.end_raw()` commands. These commands will grab the shape data just
        before it is rendered to the `Py5Graphics` object. At this stage, the
        `Py5Graphics` object contains nothing but a long list of individual lines and
        triangles. This means that a shape created with `Py5Graphics.sphere()` function
        will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a single object. Or that a
        multi-segment line shape (such as a curve) will be rendered as individual
        segments.

        When using `begin_raw()` and `Py5Graphics.end_raw()`, it's possible to write to
        either a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, `begin_raw()` with the `PDF` library
        will write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines, even if recording from
        the `P3D` renderer.

        If you want a background to show up in your files, use `rect(0, 0, width,
        height)` after setting the `Py5Graphics.fill()` to the background color.
        Otherwise the background will not be rendered to the file because the background
        is not a shape.

        This method can be used as a context manager to ensure that
        `Py5Graphics.end_raw()` always gets called, as shown in the example.

        This method is used to start a custom closed shape. This method should only be
        used as a context manager, as shown in the example. When used as a context
        manager, this will ensure that `Py5Graphics.end_shape()` always gets called,
        just like when using `Py5Graphics.begin_shape()` as a context manager. The
        difference is that when exiting, the parameter `CLOSE` will be passed to
        `Py5Graphics.end_shape()`, connecting the last vertex to the first. This will
        close the shape. If this method were to be used not as a context manager, it
        won't be able to close the shape by making the call to
        `Py5Graphics.end_shape()`.

        the source pixels (A) with the ones of pixels in the destination image (B):

        * ADD: additive blending with white clip: `C = min(A*factor + B, 255)`
        * SUBTRACT: subtractive blending with black clip: `C = max(B - A*factor, 0)`
        * DARKEST: only the darkest color succeeds: `C = min(A*factor, B)`
        * LIGHTEST: only the lightest color succeeds: `C = max(A*factor, B)`
        * DIFFERENCE: subtract colors from underlying image.
        * EXCLUSION: similar to DIFFERENCE, but less extreme.
        * MULTIPLY: Multiply the colors, result will always be darker.
        * SCREEN: Opposite multiply, uses inverse values of the colors.
        * OVERLAY: A mix of MULTIPLY and SCREEN. Multiplies dark values, and screens
        light values.
        * HARD_LIGHT: SCREEN when greater than 50% gray, MULTIPLY when lower.
        * SOFT_LIGHT: Mix of DARKEST and LIGHTEST.  Works like OVERLAY, but not as
        harsh.
        * DODGE: Lightens light tones and increases contrast, ignores darks. Called
        "Color Dodge" in Illustrator and Photoshop.
        * BURN: Darker areas are applied, increasing contrast, ignores lights. Called
        "Color Burn" in Illustrator and Photoshop.

        All modes use the alpha information (highest byte) of source image pixels as the
        blending factor. If the source and destination regions are different sizes, the

        * REPLACE: the pixels entirely replace the others and don't utilize alpha
        (transparency) values

        We recommend using `blend_mode()` and not the previous `Py5Graphics.blend()`

        The `blue()` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
        technique called bit masking. When working in `color_mode(RGB, 255)`, you can
        achieve the same results as `blue()` but with greater speed by using a bit mask
        to remove the other color components. For example, `blue(c)` and `c & 0xFF` both
        extract the blue value from a color variable `c` but the later is faster.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.

        (this value defines the curves to be Catmull-Rom splines) and the value 1.0
        connects all the points with straight lines. Values within the range -5.0 and
        5.0 will deform the curves but will leave them recognizable and as values
        increase in magnitude, they will continue to deform.

        stronger when hitting a surface squarely, and weaker if it hits at a gentle
        angle. After hitting a surface, directional light scatters in all directions.
        Lights need to be included in the `draw()` to remain persistent in a looping
        program. Placing them in the `setup()` of a looping program will cause them to
        only have an effect the first time through the loop. The `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`

        the light is facing. For example, setting `ny` to -1 will cause the geometry to

        fourth parameters to specify half of the shapes's width and height.

        `ellipse_mode(CORNER)` interprets the first two parameters of

            blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the color used to fill shapes. For example, if you run `fill(204, 102, 0)`,
        all subsequent shapes will be filled with orange. This color is either specified
        in terms of the `RGB` or `HSB` color depending on the current
        `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default color space is `RGB`, with each value in
        the range from 0 to 255.

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "`0x`" before the values
        (e.g., `0xFFCCFFAA`). The hexadecimal value must be specified with eight
        characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values.

        The value for the "gray" parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default maximum
        value is 255.

        To change the color of an image or a texture, use `Py5Graphics.tint()`.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.
        "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online "All About Colors" Python

        gray: float
            number specifying value between white and black

            green or saturation value (depending on current color mode)

            blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the color used to fill shapes. For example, if you run `fill(204, 102, 0)`,
        all subsequent shapes will be filled with orange. This color is either specified
        in terms of the `RGB` or `HSB` color depending on the current
        `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default color space is `RGB`, with each value in
        the range from 0 to 255.

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "`0x`" before the values
        (e.g., `0xFFCCFFAA`). The hexadecimal value must be specified with eight
        characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values.

        The value for the "gray" parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default maximum

        A frustum is a geometric form: a pyramid with its top cut off.  With the
        viewer's eye at the imaginary top of the pyramid, the six planes of the frustum
        act as clipping planes when rendering a 3D view.  Thus, any form inside the
        clipping planes is rendered and visible; anything outside those planes is not
        visible.

        Setting the frustum has the effect of changing the *perspective* with which the
        scene is rendered.  This can be achieved more simply in many cases by using
        `Py5Graphics.perspective()`.

        Note that the near value must be greater than zero (as the point of the frustum
        "pyramid" cannot converge "behind" the viewer).  Similarly, the far value must
        be greater than the near value (as the "far" plane of the frustum must be
        "farther away" from the viewer than the near plane).

        Works like glFrustum, except it wipes out the current perspective matrix rather
        than multiplying itself with it.

        Notes
        -----

        This function is used to enable or disable special features that control how
        graphics are drawn. In the course of developing Processing, the developers had
        to make hard decisions about tradeoffs between performance and visual quality.
        They put significant effort into determining what makes most sense for the
        largest number of users, and then use functions like `hint()` to allow people to
        tune the settings for their particular Sketch. Implementing a `hint()` is a last
        resort that's used when a more elegant solution cannot be found. Some options
        might graduate to standard features instead of hints over time, or be added and
        removed between (major) releases.

        Like other `Py5Graphics` methods, `hint()` can only be used between calls to
        `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` and `Py5Graphics.end_draw()`.

        Hints used by the Default Renderer
        ----------------------------------

        * `ENABLE_STROKE_PURE`: Fixes a problem with shapes that have a stroke and are
        rendered using small steps (for instance, using `Py5Graphics.vertex()` with
        points that are close to one another), or are drawn at small sizes.

        Hints for use with `P2D` and `P3D`
        --------------------------------------

        * `DISABLE_OPENGL_ERRORS`: Speeds up the `P3D` renderer setting by not checking
        for errors while running.
        * `DISABLE_TEXTURE_MIPMAPS`: Disable generation of texture mipmaps in `P2D` or
        `P3D`. This results in lower quality - but faster - rendering of texture images
        when they appear smaller than their native resolutions (the mipmaps are scaled-
        down versions of a texture that make it look better when drawing it at a small
        size). However, the difference in performance is fairly minor on recent desktop
        video cards.


        Hints for use with `P3D` only
        -------------------------------

        * `DISABLE_DEPTH_MASK`: Disables writing into the depth buffer. This means that
        a shape drawn with this hint can be hidden by another shape drawn later,
        irrespective of their distances to the camera. Note that this is different from
        disabling the depth test. The depth test is still applied, as long as the
        `DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST` hint is not called, but the depth values of the objects are
        not recorded. This is useful when drawing a semi-transparent 3D object without
        depth sorting, in order to avoid visual glitches due the faces of the object
        being at different distances from the camera, but still having the object
        properly occluded by the rest of the objects in the scene.
        * `ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT`: Enable primitive z-sorting of triangles and lines in
        `P3D`. This can slow performance considerably, and the algorithm is not yet
        perfect.
        * `DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST`: Disable the zbuffer, allowing you to draw on top of
        everything at will. When depth testing is disabled, items will be drawn to the
        screen sequentially, like a painting. This hint is most often used to draw in
        3D, then draw in 2D on top of it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on
        top of a 3D interface). When called, this will also clear the depth buffer.
        Restore the default with `hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_TEST)`, but note that with the depth
        buffer cleared, any 3D drawing that happens later in will ignore existing shapes
        on the screen.
        * `DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_STROKE`: Forces the `P3D` renderer to draw each shape
        (including its strokes) separately, instead of batching them into larger groups
        for better performance. One consequence of this is that 2D items drawn with
        `P3D` are correctly stacked on the screen, depending on the order in which they
        were drawn. Otherwise, glitches such as the stroke lines being drawn on top of
        the interior of all the shapes will occur. However, this hint can make rendering
        substantially slower, so it is recommended to use it only when drawing a small
        amount of shapes. For drawing two-dimensional scenes, use the `P2D` renderer
        instead, which doesn't need the hint to properly stack shapes and their strokes.
        * `ENABLE_STROKE_PERSPECTIVE`: Enables stroke geometry (lines and points) to be
        affected by the perspective, meaning that they will look smaller as they move
        away from the camera.

        This method is the same as `hint()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see
        example code for how it can be used, see `hint()`.

        The `image()` function draws an image to the Py5Graphics drawing surface. Images
        must be in the Sketch's "data" directory to load correctly. Py5 currently works
        with GIF, JPEG, and PNG images.

        The `img` parameter specifies the image to display and by default the `a` and
        `b` parameters define the location of its upper-left corner. The image is
        displayed at its original size unless the `c` and `d` parameters specify a
        different size. The `Py5Graphics.image_mode()` function can be used to change
        the way these parameters draw the image.

        Use the `u1`, `u2`, `v1`, and `v2` parameters to use only a subset of the image.
        These values are always specified in image space location, regardless of the
        current `Py5Graphics.texture_mode()` setting.

        The color of an image may be modified with the `Py5Graphics.tint()` function.
        This function will maintain transparency for GIF and PNG images.

        -----

        Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased) edges and images with hard
        edges between the pixels when enlarged rather than interpolating pixels.  Note
        that `Py5Graphics.smooth()` is active by default, so it is necessary to call
        `no_smooth()` to disable smoothing of geometry, fonts, and images. The
        `no_smooth()` method can only be run once for a `Py5Graphics` object and it must
        be called before `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()`.

        This method is the same as `no_smooth()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object.
        To see example code for how it can be used, see `no_smooth()`.

        Sets the current normal vector. Used for drawing three dimensional shapes and

        automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's imperfect, this is a
        better option when you want more control. This function is identical to

        Notes
        -----

        Draws a rectangle to the Py5Graphics drawing surface. A rectangle is a four-
        sided shape with every angle at ninety degrees. By default, the first two
        parameters set the location of the upper-left corner, the third sets the width,
        and the fourth sets the height. The way these parameters are interpreted,
        however, may be changed with the `Py5Graphics.rect_mode()` function.

        To draw a rounded rectangle, add a fifth parameter, which is used as the radius
        value for all four corners.

        To use a different radius value for each corner, include eight parameters. When
        using eight parameters, the latter four set the radius of the arc at each corner
        separately, starting with the top-left corner and moving clockwise around the
        rectangle.

        This method is the same as `rect()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see
        example code for how it can be used, see `rect()`.

        The default mode is `rect_mode(CORNER)`, which interprets the first two
        parameters of `Py5Graphics.rect()` as the upper-left corner of the shape, while
        the third and fourth parameters are its width and height.

        `rect_mode(CORNERS)` interprets the first two parameters of `Py5Graphics.rect()`
        as the location of one corner, and the third and fourth parameters as the
        location of the opposite corner.

        `rect_mode(CENTER)` interprets the first two parameters of `Py5Graphics.rect()`
        as the shape's center point, while the third and fourth parameters are its width
        and height.

        `rect_mode(RADIUS)` also uses the first two parameters of `Py5Graphics.rect()`
        as the shape's center point, but uses the third and fourth parameters to specify
        half of the shapes's width and height.

        The parameter must be written in ALL CAPS because Python is a case-sensitive
        language.

        Extracts the red value from a color, scaled to match current

        The `red()` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
        technique called bit shifting. When working in `color_mode(RGB, 255)`, you can
        achieve the same results as `red()` but with greater speed by using the right
        shift operator (`>>`) with a bit mask. For example, `red(c)` and `c >> 16 &
        0xFF` both extract the red value from a color variable `c` but the later is
        faster.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.

        degrees to radians with the `radians()` function. Coordinates are always rotated
        around their relative position to the origin. Positive numbers rotate in a
        clockwise direction and negative numbers rotate in a counterclockwise direction.
        Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to
        the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling `rotate_z(PI/2)` and
        then `rotate_z(PI/2)` is the same as `rotate_z(PI)`. If `rotate_z()` is run
        within the `draw()`, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again.
        This function requires using `P3D` as a third parameter to `size()` as shown in
        the example.

        This method is the same as `rotate_z()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To
        see example code for how it can be used, see `rotate_z()`.

        c: int
            any color value

        img: Py5Image
            image to copy into the Py5Graphics object

        x: int
            x-coordinate of the pixel

        y: int
            y-coordinate of the pixel

        Notes
        -----

        Changes the color of any pixel or writes an image directly into the Py5Graphics
        object.

        The `x` and `y` parameters specify the pixel to change and the color parameter
        specifies the color value. The color parameter `c` is affected by the current
        color mode (the default is RGB values from 0 to 255). When setting an image, the
        `x` and `y` parameters define the coordinates for the upper-left corner of the
        image, regardless of the current `Py5Graphics.image_mode()`.

        Setting the color of a single pixel with `set_pixels(x, y)` is easy, but not as
        fast as putting the data directly into `Py5Graphics.pixels[]`. The equivalent
        statement to `set_pixels(x, y, 0)` using `Py5Graphics.pixels[]` is
        `pixels[y*py5.width+x] = 0`. See the reference for `Py5Graphics.pixels[]` for
        more information.

        This method is the same as `set_pixels()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object.

        With the `P2D` and `P3D` renderers, `smooth(2)` is the default, this is called

        is determined by the hardware of the machine that is running the software, so
        `smooth(4)` and `smooth(8)` will not work with every computer.

        The default renderer uses `smooth(3)` by default. This is bicubic smoothing. The

        smoothing.

        Draws all geometry with smooth (anti-aliased) edges. This behavior is the

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values.

        The value for the gray parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default maximum
        value is 255.

        When drawing in 2D with the default renderer, you may need
        `hint(ENABLE_STROKE_PURE)` to improve drawing quality (at the expense of
        performance). See the `Py5Graphics.hint()` documentation for more details.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.
        "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online "All About Colors" Python
        Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

        extended, or rounded, each of which specified with the corresponding parameters:
        `SQUARE`, `PROJECT`, and `ROUND`. The default cap is `ROUND`.

        To make `Py5Graphics.point()` appear square, use `stroke_cap(PROJECT)`. Using
        `stroke_cap(SQUARE)` (no cap) causes points to become invisible.

        This method is the same as `stroke_cap()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object.

        Draws text to the Py5Graphics drawing surface. Displays the information
        specified in the first parameter on the drawing surface in the position
        specified by the additional parameters. A default font will be used unless a
        font is set with the `Py5Graphics.text_font()` function and a default size will
        be used unless a font is set with `Py5Graphics.text_size()`. Change the color of
        the text with the `Py5Graphics.fill()` function. The text displays in relation
        to the `Py5Graphics.text_align()` function, which gives the option to draw to
        the left, right, and center of the coordinates.

        The `x2` and `y2` parameters define a rectangular area to display within and may
        only be used with string data. When these parameters are specified, they are
        interpreted based on the current `Py5Graphics.rect_mode()` setting. Text that
        does not fit completely within the rectangle specified will not be drawn.

        Note that py5 lets you call `text()` without first specifying a Py5Font with
        `Py5Graphics.text_font()`. In that case, a generic sans-serif font will be used
        instead.

        This method is the same as `text()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see

        An optional second parameter can be used to vertically align the text.
        `BASELINE` is the default, and the vertical alignment will be reset to
        `BASELINE` if the second parameter is not used. The `TOP` and `CENTER`

        will be aligned to the bottom, with the previous lines appearing above it.

        When using `Py5Graphics.text()` with width and height parameters, `BASELINE` is
        ignored, and treated as `TOP`. (Otherwise, text would by default draw outside
        the box, since `BASELINE` is the default setting. `BASELINE` is not a useful
        drawing mode for text drawn in a rectangle.)

        The vertical alignment is based on the value of `Py5Graphics.text_ascent()`,
        which many fonts do not specify correctly. It may be necessary to use a hack and

            blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the fill value for displaying images. Images can be tinted to specified
        colors or made transparent by including an alpha value.

        To apply transparency to an image without affecting its color, use white as the
        tint color and specify an alpha value. For instance, `tint(255, 128)` will make
        an image 50% transparent (assuming the default alpha range of 0-255, which can
        be changed with `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`).

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "`0x`" before the values
        (e.g., `0xFFCCFFAA`). The hexadecimal value must be specified with eight
        characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values.

        The value for the gray parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default maximum
        value is 255.

        The `tint()` function is also used to control the coloring of textures in 3D.

        This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the
        method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g.
        "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online "All About Colors" Python
        Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

            green or saturation value (depending on current color mode)

            blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the fill value for displaying images. Images can be tinted to specified
        colors or made transparent by including an alpha value.

        To apply transparency to an image without affecting its color, use white as the
        tint color and specify an alpha value. For instance, `tint(255, 128)` will make
        an image 50% transparent (assuming the default alpha range of 0-255, which can
        be changed with `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`).

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "`0x`" before the values
        (e.g., `0xFFCCFFAA`). The hexadecimal value must be specified with eight
        characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        When using web color notation to specify a color, create a string beginning with
        the "`#`" character followed by three, four, six, or eight characters. The
        example colors `"#D93"` and `"#DD9933"` specify red, green, and blue values (in
        that order) for the color and assume the color has no transparency. The example
        colors `"#D93F"` and `"#DD9933FF"` specify red, green, blue, and alpha values
        (in that order) for the color. Notice that in web color notation the alpha
        channel is last, which is consistent with CSS colors, and in hexadecimal
        notation the alpha channel is first, which is consistent with Processing color
        values.

        The value for the gray parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by `Py5Graphics.color_mode()`. The default maximum
        value is 255.

         * vertex(x: float, y: float, z: float, /) -> None
         * vertex(x: float, y: float, z: float, u: float, v: float, /) -> None

        Parameters
        ----------

        u: float
            horizontal coordinate for the texture mapping

        v: float
            vertical coordinate for the texture mapping

        x: float
            x-coordinate of the vertex

        y: float
            y-coordinate of the vertex

        z: float
            z-coordinate of the vertex

        Notes

        Add a new vertex to a shape. All shapes are constructed by connecting a series
        of vertices. The `vertex()` method is used to specify the vertex coordinates for
        points, lines, triangles, quads, and polygons. It is used exclusively within the
        `Py5Graphics.begin_shape()` and `Py5Graphics.end_shape()` functions.

        Drawing a vertex in 3D using the `z` parameter requires the `P3D` renderer.

        This method is also used to map a texture onto geometry. The
        `Py5Graphics.texture()` function declares the texture to apply to the geometry
        and the `u` and `v` coordinates define the mapping of this texture to the form.
        By default, the coordinates used for `u` and `v` are specified in relation to
        the image's size in pixels, but this relation can be changed with the
        `Py5Graphics.texture_mode()` method.

        This method is the same as `vertex()` but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To
        see example code for how it can be used, see `vertex()`.
