    Notes
    -----

    Helper function to render a single frame using the passed `draw` function
    argument. The output is returned as a `PIL.Image` object.

    The passed function's first parameter must be either a `py5.Sketch` object or a
    `py5.Py5Graphics` object, depending on the parameter `use_py5graphics`. That
    object must be used for all of the function's py5 commands. The function can
    have additional positional and keyword arguments. To use them, pass the desired
    values as `render_frame`'s `draw_args` and `draw_kwargs` arguments.

    On macOS, only the default renderer is currently supported. Other platforms
    support the default renderer and the OpenGL renderers (P2D and P3D).

    The rendered frame can have transparent pixels if and only if the
    `use_py5graphics` parameter is `True` because only a `py5.Py5Graphics` object
    can create an image with transparency. There is no need to call
    `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` or `Py5Graphics.end_draw()` in the passed function as
    `render_frame()` does that for you.

    This function facilitates the creation and execution of a py5 Sketch, and as a
    result makes it easy to run a Sketch inside of another Sketch. This is
    discouraged, and may fail catastrophically.

    This function is available in decorator form as `@render()`."""

    function as `render_frame_sequence()` does that for you.

    Optionally the caller can pass a `setup` function, along with corresponding
