    Notes
    -----

    Datatype for providing information about key events. An instance of this class
    will be passed to user-defined key event functions if py5 detects those
    functions accept 1 (positional) argument, as demonstrated in the example code.
    The key event functions can be any of `key_pressed()`, `key_typed()`, or
    `key_released()`. Key events can be generated faster than the frame rate of the
    Sketch, making key event functions useful for capturing all of a user's keyboard
