        -----

        Create a PNG image using py5bot and embed the result in the notebook.

        This cell magic uses the same rendering mechanism as the py5bot kernel. For
        users who are familiar with Processing and py5 programming, you can pretend the
        code in this cell will be executed as a static Sketch with no `draw()` function
        and your code in the `setup()` function. The first line in the cell should be a
        call to `size()`.

        This magic is similar to `%%py5draw` in that both can be used to create a static
        Sketch. One key difference is that `%%py5bot` requires the user to begin the
        code with a call to `size()`, while `%%py5draw` calls `size()` for you based on
        the magic's arguments.

        This magic supports the default renderer and the `P2D` and `P3D` renderers. Note
        that both of the OpenGL renderers will briefly open a window on your screen.
        This magic is only available when using the py5 kernel and coding in imported
        mode. The `P2D` and `P3D` renderers are not available when the py5 kernel is
        hosted on a macOS computer.

        Code used in this cell can reference functions and variables defined in other
        cells because a copy of the user namespace is provided during execution.
        Variables and functions created in this cell will be local to only this cell
        because to do otherwise would be unsafe. Mutable objects in the user namespace,
        however, can be altered and those changes will persist elsewhere in the
        notebook. Be aware that using py5 objects in a different notebook cell or
        reusing them in another Sketch can result in nasty errors and bizzare
        consequences."""
