    Notes
    -----

    Determine if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is or is not running. When the py5
    library is imported it will start the JVM.  Therefore this will be `False`
    before `import py5` is executed and `True` afterwards. It should continue to
    always be `True` unless somewhere there is some Java code that calls
    `System.exit()`. Calling `System.exit()` is not recommended. If for some reason
    the JVM crashes (perhaps through a segmentation fault), the JVM will no longer
    be running, but that crash will most likely also terminate the Python
    interpreter."""

    Notes

    Provide JVM options to use when the JVM starts. This is useful to set the JVM
    memory size, for example.

    Notes

    Add all of the Java jar files contained in a directory and its subdirectories to
    the classpath. The path can be absolute or relative. If the directory does does
    not exist, it will be ignored.

    When `import py5` is executed, `add_jars('jars')` is called for you to
    automatically add jar files contained in a subdirectory called jars. This is
    similar to functionality provided by the Processing IDE.
