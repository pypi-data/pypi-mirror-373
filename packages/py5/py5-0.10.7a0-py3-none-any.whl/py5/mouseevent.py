class Py5MouseEvent:
    """Datatype for providing information about mouse events.

    Underlying Processing class: MouseEvent.MouseEvent

    Notes
    -----

    Datatype for providing information about mouse events. An instance of this class
    will be passed to user-defined mouse event functions if py5 detects those
    functions accept 1 (positional) argument, as demonstrated in the example code.
    The mouse event functions can be any of `mouse_clicked()`, `mouse_dragged()`,
    `mouse_moved()`, `mouse_entered()`, `mouse_exited()`, `mouse_pressed()`,
    `mouse_released()`, or `mouse_wheel()`. Mouse events can be generated faster
    than the frame rate of the Sketch, making mouse event functions useful for
    capturing all of a user's mouse activity."""
