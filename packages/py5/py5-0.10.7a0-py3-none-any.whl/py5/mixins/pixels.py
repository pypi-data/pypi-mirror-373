    Notes
    -----

    The `pixels[]` array contains the values for all the pixels in the display
    window. These values are of the color datatype. This array is defined by the
    size of the display window. For example, if the window is 100 x 100 pixels,
    there will be 10,000 values and if the window is 200 x 300 pixels, there will be
    60,000 values. When the pixel density is set to higher than 1 with the
    `pixel_density()` function, these values will change. See the reference for
    `pixel_width` or `pixel_height` for more information.

    Before accessing this array, the data must loaded with the `load_pixels()`
    function. Failure to do so may result in a Java `NullPointerException`.
    Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in `pixels` until
    `load_pixels()` is called again. After `pixels` has been modified, the
    `update_pixels()` function must be run to update the content of the display
    window."""

        writing to `pixels[]`.

        Note that `load_np_pixels()` will as a side effect call `load_pixels()`, so if

        need for a separate call to `load_pixels()`. However, be aware that modifying

        The `np_pixels[]` array contains the values for all the pixels in the display
        window. Unlike the one dimensional array `pixels[]`, the `np_pixels[]` array
        organizes the color data in a 3 dimensional numpy array. The size of the array's
        dimensions are defined by the size of the display window. The first dimension is
        the height, the second is the width, and the third represents the color
        channels. The color channels are ordered alpha, red, green, blue (ARGB). Every
        value in `np_pixels[]` is an integer between 0 and 255.

        This numpy array is very similar to the image arrays used by other popular
        Python image libraries, but note that many of them will arrange the channels in
        a different order such as RGBA or BGR.

        When the pixel density is set to higher than 1 with the `pixel_density()`
        function, the size of `np_pixels[]`'s height and width dimensions will change.
        See the reference for `pixel_width` or `pixel_height` for more information.
        Nothing about `np_pixels[]` will change as a result of calls to `color_mode()`.

        Much like the `pixels[]` array, there are load and update methods that must be
        called before and after making changes to the data in `np_pixels[]`. Before
        accessing `np_pixels[]`, the data must be loaded with the `load_np_pixels()`
        method. If this is not done, `np_pixels` will be equal to `None` and your code
        will likely result in Python exceptions. After `np_pixels[]` has been modified,
        the `update_np_pixels()` method must be called to update the content of the
        display window.

        To set the entire contents of `np_pixels[]` to the contents of another properly
        sized numpy array, consider using `set_np_pixels()`.

        Set the entire contents of `np_pixels[]` to the contents of another properly
        sized and typed numpy array. The size of `array`'s first and second dimensions
        must match the height and width of the Sketch window, respectively. The array's
        `dtype` must be `np.uint8`.

        The `bands` parameter is used to interpret the `array`'s color channel dimension
        (the array's third dimension). It can be one of `'L'` (single-channel
        grayscale), `'ARGB'`, `'RGB'`, or `'RGBA'`. If there is no alpha channel,
        `array` is assumed to have no transparency, but recall that the display window's
        pixels can never be transparent so any transparency in `array` will have no
        effect. If the `bands` parameter is `'L'`, `array`'s third dimension is
        optional.

        This method makes its own calls to `load_np_pixels()` and `update_np_pixels()`
        so there is no need to call either explicitly.

        This method exists because setting the array contents with the code
        `py5.np_pixels = array` will cause an error, while the correct syntax,
        `py5.np_pixels[:] = array`, might also be unintuitive for beginners."""

        alpha channel in that format.

        `Py5Graphics.pixels[]`, the `np_pixels[]` array organizes the color data in a 3

        size of the Py5Graphics drawing surface. The first dimension is the height, the
        second is the width, and the third represents the color channels. The color
        channels are ordered alpha, red, green, blue (ARGB). Every value in
        `np_pixels[]` is an integer between 0 and 255.

        This numpy array is very similar to the image arrays used by other popular
        Python image libraries, but note that some of them like opencv will by default
        order the color channels as RGBA.

        Set the entire contents of `Py5Graphics.np_pixels[]` to the contents of another
        properly sized and typed numpy array. The size of `array`'s first and second
        dimensions must match the height and width of the Py5Graphics drawing surface,
        respectively. The array's `dtype` must be `np.uint8`. This must be used after
        `Py5Graphics.begin_draw()` but can be used after `Py5Graphics.end_draw()`.

        The `bands` parameter is used to interpret the `array`'s color channel dimension
        (the array's third dimension). It can be one of `'L'` (single-channel
        grayscale), `'ARGB'`, `'RGB'`, or `'RGBA'`. If there is no alpha channel,
        `array` is assumed to have no transparency. Unlike the main drawing window, a
        Py5Graphics drawing surface's pixels can be transparent so using the alpha
        channel will work properly. If the `bands` parameter is `'L'`, `array`'s third
        dimension is optional.

        This method makes its own calls to `Py5Graphics.load_np_pixels()` and
        `Py5Graphics.update_np_pixels()` so there is no need to call either explicitly.

        This method exists because setting the array contents with the code `g.np_pixels

        -----

        Get the contents of `Py5Graphics.np_pixels[]` as a numpy array. The returned
        numpy array can be the entirety of `Py5Graphics.np_pixels[]` or a rectangular
        subsection. Use the `x`, `y`, `h`, and `w` parameters to specify the bounds of a
        rectangular subsection.

        The `bands` parameter is used to determine the ordering of the returned numpy
        array's color channel. It can be one of `'L'` (single-channel grayscale),
        `'ARGB'`, `'RGB'`, or `'RGBA'`. If the `bands` parameter is `'L'`, the returned
        array will have two dimensions, and each pixel value will be calculated as
        `0.299 * red + 0.587 * green + 0.114 * blue`. The alpha channel will also be
        ignored. For all other `bands` parameter values, the returned array will have
        three dimensions, with the third dimension representing the different color
        channels specified by the `bands` value.

        The returned array will always be a copy of the data in
        `Py5Graphics.np_pixels[]` and not a view into that array or any other array. Use
        the `dst` parameter to provide the numpy array to copy the pixel data into. The

        You can use any of the following signatures:

         * get_np_pixels(*, bands: str = "ARGB", dst: npt.NDArray[np.uint8] = None) -> npt.NDArray[np.uint8]
         * get_np_pixels(x: int, y: int, w: int, h: int, /, *, bands: str = "ARGB", dst: npt.NDArray[np.uint8] = None) -> npt.NDArray[np.uint8]

        Parameters
        ----------

        bands: str = "ARGB"
            color channels in output array

        dst: npt.NDArray[np.uint8] = None
            destination array to copy pixel data into

        h: int
            source height

        w: int
            source width

        x: int
            x-coordinate of the source's upper left corner

        y: int
            y-coordinate of the source's upper left corner

        Notes
        -----

        Get the contents of `Py5Image.np_pixels[]` as a numpy array. The returned numpy
        array can be the entirety of `Py5Image.np_pixels[]` or a rectangular subsection.
        Use the `x`, `y`, `h`, and `w` parameters to specify the bounds of a rectangular
        subsection.

        The `bands` parameter is used to determine the ordering of the returned numpy
        array's color channel. It can be one of `'L'` (single-channel grayscale),
        `'ARGB'`, `'RGB'`, or `'RGBA'`. If the `bands` parameter is `'L'`, the returned
        array will have two dimensions, and each pixel value will be calculated as
        `0.299 * red + 0.587 * green + 0.114 * blue`. The alpha channel will also be
        ignored. For all other `bands` parameter values, the returned array will have
        three dimensions, with the third dimension representing the different color
        channels specified by the `bands` value.

        The returned array will always be a copy of the data in `Py5Image.np_pixels[]`
        and not a view into that array or any other array. Use the `dst` parameter to
        provide the numpy array to copy the pixel data into. The provided array must be
        sized correctly. The array's `dtype` should `np.uint8`, but this isn't required.

        Save the Py5Image object to an image file. This method uses the Python library
        Pillow to write the image, so it can save images in any format that that library
        supports.

        Use the `drop_alpha` parameter to drop the alpha channel from the image. This
        defaults to `True`. Some image formats such as JPG do not support alpha
        channels, and Pillow will throw an error if you try to save an image with the
        alpha channel in that format.

        The `use_thread` parameter will save the image in a separate Python thread. This
        improves performance by returning before the image has actually been written to
        the file."""
