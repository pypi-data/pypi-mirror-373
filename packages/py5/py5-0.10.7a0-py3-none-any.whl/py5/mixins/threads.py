        -----

        Launch a new thread to execute a function in parallel with your Sketch code.
        This can be useful for executing non-py5 code that would otherwise slow down the
        animation thread and reduce the Sketch's frame rate.

        The `name` parameter is optional but useful if you want to monitor the thread
        with other methods such as `has_thread()`. If the provided `name` is identical
        to an already running thread, the running thread will first be stopped with a
        call to `stop_thread()` with the `wait` parameter equal to `True`.

        Use the `args` and `kwargs` parameters to pass positional and keyword arguments
        to the function.

        Use the `daemon` parameter to make the launched thread a daemon that will run
        without blocking Python from exiting. This parameter defaults to `True`, meaning
        that function execution can be interupted if the Python process exits. Note that
        if the Python process continues running after the Sketch exits, which is
        typically the case when using a Jupyter Notebook, this parameter won't have any
        effect unless if you try to restart the Notebook kernel. Generally speaking,
        setting this parameter to `False` causes problems but it is available for those
        who really need it. See `stop_all_threads()` for a better approach to exit
        threads.

        The new thread is a Python thread, so all the usual caveats about the Global
        Interpreter Lock (GIL) apply here."""

        Notes
        -----

        Create a `Py5Promise` object that will store the returned result of a function
        when that function completes. This can be useful for executing non-py5 code that
        would otherwise slow down the animation thread and reduce the Sketch's frame
        rate.

        The `Py5Promise` object has an `is_ready` property that will be `True` when the
        `result` property contains the value function `f` returned. Before then, the
        `result` property will be `None`.

        The `name` parameter is optional but useful if you want to monitor the thread
        with other methods such as `has_thread()`. If the provided `name` is identical
        to an already running thread, the running thread will first be stopped with a

        Notes
        -----

        Launch a new thread that will repeatedly execute a function in parallel with
        your Sketch code. This can be useful for executing non-py5 code that would
        otherwise slow down the animation thread and reduce the Sketch's frame rate.

        Use the `time_delay` parameter to set the time in seconds between one call to
        function `f` and the next call. Set this parameter to `0` if you want each call
        to happen immediately after the previous call finishes. If the function `f`
        takes longer than expected to finish, py5 will wait for it to finish before
        making the next call. There will not be overlapping calls to function `f`.

        The `name` parameter is optional but useful if you want to monitor the thread
        with other methods such as `has_thread()`. If the provided `name` is identical
        to an already running thread, the running thread will first be stopped with a

        -----

        Stop a thread of a given name. The `wait` parameter determines if the method

        This won't do anything useful if the thread was launched with either
        `launch_thread()` or `launch_promise_thread()` and the `wait` parameter is
        `False`. Non-repeating threads are executed once and will stop when they
        complete execution. Setting the `wait` parameter to `True` will merely block
        until the thread exits on its own. Killing off a running thread in Python is
        complicated and py5 cannot do that for you. If you want a thread to perform some
        action repeatedly and be interuptable, use `launch_repeating_thread()` instead.

        Use `has_thread()` to determine if a thread of a given name exists and
        `list_threads()` to get a list of all thread names. Use `stop_all_threads()` to
