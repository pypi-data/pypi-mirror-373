        There are security risks associated with Python pickle files. A pickle file can
        contain malicious code, so never load a pickle file from an untrusted source.

        When using py5 in imported mode, pickling will not work on objects instantiated
        from new classes you have defined yourself on the main sketch file. This applies
        to py5's `save_pickle()` and `load_pickle()` methods, as well as the Python's
        standard library pickle module methods they depend upon. If you need to pickle
        objects from classes you defined, move the class definitions to a different .py
        file that you import as a module or import the classes from. Otherwise, you
        could also try using module mode if you want to use pickle with your classes and

        be saved relative to the current working directory (`sketch_path()`). The saved

        Object "pickling" is a technique for serializing objects and saving them to a
        file for later retrieval. The recreated objects will be clones of the original
        objects. Not all Python objects can be saved to a Python pickle file. This
        limitation prevents any py5 object from being pickled.

        When using py5 in imported mode, pickling will not work on objects instantiated
        from new classes you have defined yourself on the main sketch file. This applies
        to py5's `save_pickle()` and `load_pickle()` methods, as well as the Python's
