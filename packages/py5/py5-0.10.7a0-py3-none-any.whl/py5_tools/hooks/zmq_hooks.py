    Notes
    -----

    Creates a portal widget to continuously stream frames from a running Sketch into
    a Jupyter notebook. Each frame will appear embedded in the notebook, with each
    new frame replacing the previous frame.

    **Unfortunately, the Sketch Portal feature had to be removed from py5 in release
    0.10.0. Changes to Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Widgets somehow broke the code and it
    was too difficult to figure out why. Rather than fix the code, the Sketch Portal
    will be re-implemented using the Python library anywidget. This new approach
    will hopefully be simpler to implement and easier to maintain.**

    By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by
    `get_current_sketch()`. Use the `sketch` parameter to specify a different
    running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using class mode.

    The Sketch Portal is a custom Jupyter Widget and can handle keyboard or mouse
    events just like a native window. You will need to click on the portal for it to
    gain focus and capture keyboard events. Mouse and keyboard events will be
    observed by the browser and simulated events will be created for the Sketch.
    Every effort has been made to make the simulated events identical to real events
    but some small differences remain. You can also use the Jupyter-provided Widgets
    such as sliders and text boxes for user input.

    This function is intended to be used when a real display is not available, such
    as when using py5 through an online Jupyter notebook system like binder
    (mybinder.org). You are free to execute code elsewhere in the notebook while the
    Sketch is running and the portal is open. This function can only be used in a
    Jupyter Notebook. It uses ZMQ to stream JPEG images from the kernel to the
    client front-end.

    If you are using Jupyter Lab, try right clicking in the output area of the cell
    and selecting "Create New View for Output". This will create a new panel just
    for the Sketch Portal. Creating a "New Console for Notebook" and creating a
    portal there works well also.

    This command can be called before `run_sketch()` if the current Sketch is in the
    `is_ready` state.

    Use the `time_limit` parameter to set a time limit (seconds). Use
    `throttle_frame_rate` to throttle the stream's frame rate (frames per second) to
    a slower pace than the Sketch's actual draw frame rate. By default,
    `throttle_frame_rate` is set to 30, which is half of the Sketch's default draw
    frame rate of 60 frames per second. Set this parameter to `None` to disable
    throttling. The `scale` parameter is a scaling factor that can adjust the portal
    height and width. The `quality` parameter sets the JPEG quality factor (default
    75) for the stream, which must be between 1 (worst) and 100 (best). If the
    portal causes the Sketch's frame rate to drop, try adjusting the portal's
    throttle frame rate, quality, and scale.

    If your Sketch has a `post_draw()` method, use the `hook_post_draw` parameter to
    make this function run after `post_draw()` instead of `draw()`. This is
    important when using Processing libraries that support `post_draw()` such as
    Camera3D or ColorBlindness.

    To stop a Sketch Portal, wait for the time limit to expire, call
    `exit_sketch()`, or press the "exit_sketch()" button below the portal. If you
    delete the cell with the `Py5SketchPortal` object, the portal will no longer be
    visible but the Sketch will still be streaming frames to the notebook client,
    wasting resources. A Sketch can only have one open portal, so opening a new
    portal with different options will replace an existing portal."""
