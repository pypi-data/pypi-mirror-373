                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

==================================
histogrammar Python implementation
==================================

histogrammar is a Python package for creating histograms. histogrammar has multiple histogram types,
supports numeric and categorical features, and works with Numpy arrays and Pandas and Spark dataframes.
Once a histogram is filled, it's easy to plot it, store it in JSON format (and retrieve it), or convert
it to Numpy arrays for further analysis.

At its core histogrammar is a suite of data aggregation primitives designed for use in parallel processing.
In the simplest case, you can use this to compute histograms, but the generality of the primitives
allows much more.

Several common histogram types can be plotted in Matplotlib and Bokeh with a single method call.
If Numpy or Pandas is available, histograms and other aggregators can be filled from arrays ten to a hundred times
more quickly via Numpy commands, rather than Python for loops.

This Python implementation of histogrammar been tested to guarantee compatibility with its Scala implementation.

Latest Python release: v1.1.2 (Sep 2025).
Latest update: Sep 2025.

References
==========

Histogrammar is a core component of `popmon <https://github.com/ing-bank/popmon>`_, a package by ING bank
that allows one to check the stability of a dataset. popmon works with both pandas and spark datasets,
largely thanks to Histogrammar.

Changes
-------

See Changes log `here <https://github.com/histogrammar/histogrammar-python/blob/master/CHANGES.rst>`_.


Spark
-----

With Spark, make sure to pick up the correct histogrammar jar files. Spark 4.X is based on Scala 2.13; Spark 3.X is based on Scala 2.12 or 2.13.

.. code-block:: python

  spark = SparkSession.builder.config("spark.jars.packages", "io.github.histogrammar:histogrammar_2.13:1.0.30,io.github.histogrammar:histogrammar-sparksql_2.13:1.0.30").getOrCreate()


For Scala 2.12, in the string above simply replace "2.13" with "2.12".

Documentation
=============

See `histogrammar-docs <https://histogrammar.github.io/histogrammar-docs/>`_ for a complete introduction to `histogrammar`.
(A bit old but still good.) There you can also find documentation about the Scala implementation of `histogrammar`.

Check it out
============

The `historgrammar` library requires Python 3.8+ and is pip friendly. To get started, simply do:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install histogrammar

or check out the code from our GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/histogrammar/histogrammar-python
  $ pip install -e histogrammar-python

where in this example the code is installed in edit mode (option -e).

You can now use the package in Python with:

.. code-block:: python

  import histogrammar

**Congratulations, you are now ready to use the histogrammar library!**

Quick run
=========

As a quick example, you can do:

.. code-block:: python

  import pandas as pd
  import histogrammar as hg
  from histogrammar import resources

  # open synthetic data
  df = pd.read_csv(resources.data('test.csv.gz'), parse_dates=['date'])
  df.head()

  # create a histogram, tell it to look for column 'age'
  # fill the histogram with column 'age' and plot it
  hist = hg.Histogram(num=100, low=0, high=100, quantity='age')
  hist.fill.numpy(df)
  hist.plot.matplotlib()

  # generate histograms of all features in the dataframe using automatic binning
  # (importing histogrammar automatically adds this functionality to a pandas or spark dataframe)
  hists = df.hg_make_histograms()
  print(hists.keys())

  # multi-dimensional histograms are also supported. e.g. features longitude vs latitude
  hists = df.hg_make_histograms(features=['longitude:latitude'])
  ll = hists['longitude:latitude']
  ll.plot.matplotlib()

  # store histogram and retrieve it again
  ll.toJsonFile('longitude_latitude.json')
  ll2 = hg.Factory().fromJsonFile('longitude_latitude.json')

These examples also work with Spark dataframes (sdf):

.. code-block:: python

  from pyspark.sql.functions import col
  hist = hg.Histogram(num=100, low=0, high=100, quantity=col('age'))
  hist.fill.sparksql(sdf)

For more examples please see the example notebooks and tutorials.
