# ledger2bql
Translate Ledger CLI query syntax into BQL

Implemented in Python.

# Introduction

BQL is quite a powerful language for slicing and dicing Beancount data. But, when all you need are simple queries, writing every field and filter seems tedios. In comparison, Ledger CLI's syntax is short and efficient. A simple `l b bank` will list all bank accounts, assuming a well-organized account tree.

The purpose of this project, a simple CLI utility, is to accept a Ledger-like syntax, generate an appropriate BQL statement, and run it for you.
