# ledger2bql
Translate Ledger CLI query syntax into BQL

Implemented in Python.

# Introduction

BQL is quite a powerful language for slicing and dicing Beancount data. But, when all you need are simple queries, writing every field and filter seems tedios. In comparison, Ledger CLI's syntax is short and efficient. A simple `l b bank` will list all bank accounts, assuming a well-organized account tree.

The purpose of this project, a simple CLI utility, is to accept a Ledger-like syntax, generate an appropriate BQL statement, and run it for you.

# Development

## Setup
Add an `.env` file, specifying the `BEANCOUNT_FILE` location.
```
BEANCOUNT_FILE=tests/sample_ledger.bean
```

```sh
uv sync
```

## Build
```sh
uv build
```

## Run
```sh
uv run ledger2bql
```
or run
```sh
l ...
```
# Usage

Set the `BEANCOUNT_FILE` variable to point to your Beancount ledger file.

Run
```sh
ledger2bql b card
ledger2bql r card -b 2025-08-01
```

To get the list of available parameters, simply run
```sh
ledger2bql
ledger2bql bal --help
ledger2bql reg --help
```
