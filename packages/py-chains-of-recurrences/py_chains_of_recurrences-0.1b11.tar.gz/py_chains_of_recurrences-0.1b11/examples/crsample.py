'''
This file contains a sample program, which computes values of a given closed
form expression over an n-dimensional tensor, using MCR technique, and shows the time 
of the computation performed. Parallelization is not fully implemented

User has to provide a function string and a matrix of parameters.

The pycr.py file contains all of the necessary parsing and construction
of CR's

There are two important functions: evalcr and crgen that evaluate a function
or construct minimal python code
