# This Docker Compose file creates a PostgreSQL and infinity-grid container.
#
# In order to use this file to run the trading algorithm, a few environment
# variables must be set, see https://infinity-grid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for
# more information.
#
# Note: For running multiple instances of the infinity-grid in parallel, you can
#       simply duplicate and configure the service, as it supports sharing the
#       same database. BUT: Keep in mind to use different API keys as well as
#       different userref's! Otherwise you will encounter errors.
