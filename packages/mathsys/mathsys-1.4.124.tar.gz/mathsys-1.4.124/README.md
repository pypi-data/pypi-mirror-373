*Mathsys* is a *DSL* (*Domain-Specific Language*) aimed to make math writing easier on computers, and something machines can actually understand.

*Mathsys* bridges the gap between traditional mathematical notation and programming languages. It provides a hybrid syntax that maintains mathematical readability while adding programming language features like multi-character variables and structured expressions.

## Installation
Install the latest version via pip:

```sh
pip install mathsys
```

### Package
To use the package, simply import it:
```py
import mathsys
```

It is recommended that you import a version especifically, the only version available right now is `dev`:
```py
import mathsys.dev as mathsys
```

That later way ensures you always use that version, no matter the updates that the package receives.

### CLI
Compile a Mathsys file to different targets with:

```sh
python -m mathsys <target> <filename>.math
```

You will need `rustc` installed with the target you are compiling to. If that feels too cumbersome (it really is), try it out first on [Abscissa.](https://app.abscissa.eu/playground)

> [!NOTE]
> Compiling via command line will also output a `.ltx` file with the *LaTeX.*

## Project Status
Mathsys is actively developed with regular releases every 1-3 weeks. This project is still in its early stages, so expect major shifts and changes. Most features aren't close to being developed yet.

I say *we* but I'm indeed a solo developer for now, so if you want to get involved learn

## Technical Background
- **Parser:** A [lark parser](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) based on *Earley* that tokenizes the source and builds the *AST.*
- **LaTeX:** Our custom *LaTeX* generator that traverses the *AST* and outputs easy-to-read *LaTeX.*
- **IR:** A fully binary *Intermediate Representation.*
- **Runtime:** *Rust* based `no_std` runtime which interprets the *IR* embedded into it and implements control-flow for low-level operations.
- **Assembly:** For low-level operations which require speed and don't need memory safety.
