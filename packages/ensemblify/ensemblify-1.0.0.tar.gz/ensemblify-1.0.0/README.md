### üí° What is Ensemblify?

**Ensemblify** is a Python package that can generate protein conformational ensembles by sampling dihedral angle values from a three-residue fragment database and inserting them into flexible regions of a protein of interest (*e.g.* intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)).

It supports both user-defined models and AlphaFold<sup>[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2)</sup> predictions, using the predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) and Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) confidence metrics to guide conformational sampling. Designed to enhance the study of IDRs, it allows flexible customization of sampling parameters and works with single or multi-chain proteins, offering a powerful tool for protein structure research. Ensemble analysis and reweighting with experimental data is also available through interactive graphical dashboards.

### üß∞ How do I install Ensemblify?
Step-by-step instructions for installing Ensemblify are available in the [Documentation](https://ensemblify.readthedocs.io/latest/installation.html).

### üíª How can I use Ensemblify?
Ensemblify can be used either as a Command Line Interface (CLI):

    conda activate ensemblify_env
    (ensemblify_env) $ ensemblify [options]

or as a Python library inside a script or Jupyter notebook:

    import ensemblify as ey
    ey.show_config()

Check the [Documentation](https://ensemblify.readthedocs.io/latest/usage.html) for more details.

### üîé How does Ensemblify work?
A general overview of Ensemblify, descriptions of employed methods and applications can be found in the Ensemblify [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.26.672300v1) and accompanying support information.

## üóÉ Tripeptide Database

Ensemblify provides a three-residue fragment (tripeptide) database from which to sample dihedral angle values.

This database is provided separately from the Ensemblify source-code.

You can get it [here](https://zenodo.org/records/16948909) and more about its creation in the [Documentation](https://ensemblify.readthedocs.io/latest/database.html).

## üìö Accessing Documentation

Ensemblify's documentation is available together with an API reference at https://ensemblify.readthedocs.io.
Alternatively, the source-code contains docstrings with relevant information.
