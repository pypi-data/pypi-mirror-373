Modifications:

The pulchra_CHANGED.c file is a modified version of the original source code file pulchra.c,
with the addition of the following code on line 3024:

    // Display all conflicts after all iterations
    res = chain->residua;
    while (res) {
        if (res->protein) {
            display_conflicts(res, grid, xgrid, ygrid, zgrid);
        }
        res = res->next;
    }

This makes it so PULCHRA outputs the residue numbers of the residues involved in a steric
clash when it detects one.
All other files taken from the original distribution were not modified in any way.
