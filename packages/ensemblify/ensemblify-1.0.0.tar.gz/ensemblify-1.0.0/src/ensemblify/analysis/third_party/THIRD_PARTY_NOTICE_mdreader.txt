Modifications:
--------------

The simple_mdreader.py file is a modified version of the original source code file
./mdreader-master/mdreader.py, and contains a modified version of the original MDReader class:
SimpleMDReader.
The main changes made consisted in:
    - removing functionalities that were not used through Ensemblify;
    - removing support for Python versions <=2.7;
    - documenting and styling the code to be consistent with the rest of Ensemblify's source code.
    
The functionality of the code remained essentially the same, so any novel or interesting code
implementations spotted can be fully attributed to MDReader's original creator, Manuel M. Melo.
