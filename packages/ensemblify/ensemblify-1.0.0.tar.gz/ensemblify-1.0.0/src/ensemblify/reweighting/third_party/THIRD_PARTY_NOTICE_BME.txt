Modifications:
--------------

The simple_BME.py and simple_BME_tools.py files are a modified version of the original source code
files ./BME_main/BME.py and ./BME_main/BME_tools.py, and contain a modified version of the original
Reweight class, SimpleReweight, and its auxiliary functions.
The main changes made consisted in:
    - removing functionalities that were not used through Ensemblify;
    - documenting and styling the code to be consistent with the rest of Ensemblify's source code.

The functionality of the code remained essentially the same, so any novel or interesting code
implementations spotted can be fully attributed to BME's original authors.
