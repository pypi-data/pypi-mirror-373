**A revolutionary computational framework for modeling consciousness emergence from multi-omics biological data.**

The Pan-Omics Consciousness Engine (PCE) is a revolutionary computational framework that integrates cutting-edge advances in quantum biology, evolutionary dynamics, graph neural networks, and consciousness theory to model and quantify consciousness emergence from complex biological systems.

## 🧠 Overview

PCE represents the first comprehensive attempt to bridge the explanatory gap between biological complexity and consciousness through rigorous computational modeling. The system combines five integrated subsystems to create a unified framework for consciousness emergence quantification:

### Core Philosophy

- **Biological Realism**: Grounded in empirical neuroscience and consciousness research
- **Quantum-Classical Bridge**: Integrates quantum coherence effects with classical biological dynamics
- **Multi-Scale Integration**: From molecular to network-level consciousness phenomena
- **Emergence Detection**: Quantitative metrics for consciousness level assessment
- **Patent-Ready Architecture**: Novel algorithmic contributions suitable for intellectual property protection

## 🏗️ Architecture

PCE consists of five deeply integrated subsystems:

### 1. MOGIL - Multi-Omics Graph Integration Layer

- **Purpose**: Hypergraph construction and graph neural network encoding
- **Innovation**: Attention-weighted hypergraphs with temporal dynamics
- **Input**: Multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomics)
- **Output**: High-dimensional biological embeddings

### 2. Q-LEM - Quantum-Latent Entropy Minimizer

- **Purpose**: Bio-quantum entropy functional optimization
- **Innovation**: Von Neumann entropy minimization for biological quantum states
- **Theory**: Bio-quantum entropy functional F = H(S) - αE + βC
- **Output**: Quantum-coherent biological state representations

### 3. E³DE - Entropic Evolutionary Dynamics Engine

- **Purpose**: Physics-based evolutionary simulation with consciousness tracking
- **Innovation**: Entropy-driven selection pressure with consciousness emergence detection
- **Theory**: Information-theoretic fitness functions with consciousness complexity metrics
- **Output**: Evolutionary trajectories toward consciousness complexity

### 4. HDTS - Hierarchical Digital Twin Simulator

- **Purpose**: Multi-scale biological simulation (L0: Molecular → L5: Organism)  
- **Innovation**: Adaptive resolution with cross-scale consciousness propagation
- **Theory**: Hierarchical consciousness emergence across biological scales
- **Output**: Multi-scale consciousness dynamics and coherence metrics

### 5. CIS - Consciousness-Integration Substrate

- **Purpose**: Final consciousness quantification and integration
- **Innovation**: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) + Global Workspace Theory (GWT) fusion
- **Theory**: Variational manifold consciousness representation with φ (phi) quantification
- **Output**: Comprehensive consciousness metrics and emergence analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pce-project/pce.git
cd pce

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "import pce; print(f'PCE v{pce.__version__} ready!')"
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import pce

# Load multi-omics data
data = pce.create_toy_dataset('toy_genomics', 10, 5)

# Quick consciousness analysis
metrics = pce.quick_consciousness_analysis(
    data, 
    integration_cycles=3,
    save_results=False
)

print(f"Consciousness φ (Phi): {metrics.phi:.6f}")
print(f"Consciousness Level: {metrics.consciousness_level:.6f}") 
print(f"Global Accessibility: {metrics.global_accessibility:.6f}")
print(f"Category: {metrics.consciousness_category.name}")

# Example output:
# Consciousness φ (Phi): 0.000639
# Consciousness Level: 0.107696
# Global Accessibility: 0.200000
# Category: SUBCONSCIOUS
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Create full PCE system
pce_system = pce.create_pce_system()

# Process through all subsystems
hypergraph = pce_system.mogil.build_hypergraph(data)
embedding = pce_system.mogil.encode_hypergraph(hypergraph)

# Quantum optimization
pce_system.qlem.create_quantum_state(embedding)
pce_system.qlem.minimize_entropy(embedding)

# Evolutionary simulation
pce_system.e3de.create_population("neural_evolution", 100, 50, embedding)
evolution_metrics = pce_system.e3de.evolve_population("neural_evolution", 25)

# Multi-scale simulation
pce_system.hdts.create_biological_system(embedding)
simulation_results = pce_system.hdts.simulate_consciousness_emergence(1.0)

# Final consciousness integration
pce_system.create_connectome(embedding)
final_metrics = pce_system.integrate_consciousness()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = pce_system.consciousness_report()
```

## 🖥️ Command Line Interface

PCE provides a comprehensive CLI for all functionality:

```bash
# Load and analyze data
pan-omic-ce load --dataset toy_neural_omics --format auto

# Run individual subsystems  
pan-omic-ce mogil --build-hypergraph --encode

```

## 📊 Scientific Foundations

### Consciousness Theory Integration

PCE uniquely combines multiple consciousness theories:

- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: φ (phi) calculation for consciousness quantification
- **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Global accessibility and information broadcasting  
- **Quantum Consciousness**: Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) compatible modeling
- **Information Integration**: Variational information bottleneck principles
- **Emergence Theory**: Complex systems approaches to consciousness emergence

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Bio-Quantum Entropy Functional

```txt
F[ρ, E, C] = H(ρ) - α⟨E⟩ + β⟨C⟩

Where:
- H(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ) (von Neumann entropy)
- ⟨E⟩ = Tr(ρH) (expected energy)  
- ⟨C⟩ = complexity measure
- α, β = coupling parameters
```

#### Consciousness φ (Phi) Calculation

```txt
φ = ∫ Φ(X → Y) dμ(X,Y)

Where:
- Φ(X → Y) = cause-effect power between partitions
- μ(X,Y) = partition probability measure
- Integration over all possible system partitions
```

#### Evolutionary Fitness Function

```txt
F_evo = I(X; Y) + λS(X) - γE(X)

Where:
- I(X; Y) = mutual information (consciousness complexity)
- S(X) = entropy (diversity pressure)
- E(X) = energy cost
- λ, γ = selection parameters
```

## 🔬 Validation & Testing

PCE includes comprehensive validation:

- **Synthetic Data Validation**: Controlled consciousness emergence scenarios
- **Biological Data Integration**: Real multi-omics datasets from neural systems

**PCE - Bridging the gap between biological complexity and consciousness through rigorous computational modeling.**

*"The emergence of consciousness from biological complexity represents one of nature's most profound phenomena. PCE provides the first comprehensive computational framework to quantify, model, and understand this emergence through the integration of quantum biology, evolutionary dynamics, and consciousness theory."*

The Pan-Omics Consciousness Engine (PCE) is a revolutionary computational framework that unifies genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, and connectomics into a single, living digital substrate. Unlike traditional bioinformatics tools that analyze static datasets, PCE creates dynamic, evolving simulations that mirror the entropic and evolutionary dynamics of life itself.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🧬 Multi-Omics Integration**: Unified hypergraph representation of all biological layers
- **🔬 Quantum-Inspired Latent Space**: Tensor-network-like embeddings for complex biological relationships
- **🌊 Entropic Optimization**: Physics-based functional driving system evolution: `F = H(S) - αE + βC`
- **🧠 Evolutionary Dynamics**: Self-modifying system with mutation, recombination, and network rewiring
- **🔄 Hierarchical Digital Twins**: Multi-scale simulation from molecules to ecosystems
- **🌌 Consciousness Integration**: Speculative modeling of emergent cognitive states
- **⚡ Adaptive Compute**: Dynamic resource allocation based on entropy anomalies
- **🔌 Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom omics adapters and operators

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

    omics_data, 
    temporal=True, 
    use_attention=True
)

# Create quantum-latent embedding
latent_space = pce.qlem.LatentSpace(dim=256)
embeddings = latent_space.fit_transform(hypergraph)

# Define entropy functional
entropy_func = pce.qlem.EntropyFunctional(
