
Termination
===========

Tasks can be terminated if any of the
following are met:

- Task has run longer than its timeout
- Task's ``end_cond`` is true
- Scheduler is immediately shutting down

This section discusses these ways to terminate tasks.

.. warning::

    Only ``async``, ``thread`` and ``process`` tasks can be terminated. 
    Read more about the execution methods: 
    `execution method handbook <handbook-execution>`.

.. warning::

    If you use threaded execution, you should periodically check
    the termination flag status and raise termination exception
    if it is set in order to correctly handle the termination:

    .. code-block:: python

        from rocketry.args import TerminationFlag
        from rocketry.exc import TaskTerminationException

        @app.task(execution="thread")
        def do_thread(flag=TerminationFlag()):
            while True:
                ... # Do something
                if flag.is_set():
                    raise TaskTerminationException()

.. warning::

    If you use async execution, you should release the execution 
    in order to make it possible for the scheduler to terminate it:

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio

        @app.task(execution="async")
        async def do_async():
            ... # Do things
            await asyncio.sleep(0)
            ... # Do more

Timeout
-------

Timeout defines how long the task may run. It can be set on session level
and on task level. Task level timeout overrides the session setting so 
if a task does not have timeout specified the session setting is used 
instead.

To set it on task level:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.task(timeout="1 hour", execution="process")
    def do_things():
        ...

To set it on session level:

.. code-block:: python

    from rocketry import Rocketry

    app = Rocketry(config={"timeout": 0.1})

    @app.task(timeout="1 hour", execution="process")
    def do_things():
        ...

The timeout can be as:

- int or float (number of seconds)
- string (timedelta string)
- ``datetime.timedelta``

End Condition
-------------

End condition is a condition that when true, the task is terminated.
This is useful to prevent some tasks to run outside their intended 
period. For example, you may want to kill all running less important 
tasks when the actual production starts.

For example, this task will be terminated if it is running between
08:00 and 18:00 (8 am to 6 pm): 

.. code-block:: python

    from rocketry.conds import time_of_day

    @app.task(end_cond=time_of_day.between("08:00", "18:00"))
    def do_things():
        ...

Scheduler Shutdown
------------------

If scheduler shuts down with no errors (either shut_down was called or 
the scheduler shut condition was reached), the scheduler waits for the
running tasks to finish or to reach their timeout or end condition.

However, the scheduler will terminate all tasks during shutdown if:

- Scheduler encountered a fatal error
- The configuration :ref:`instant_shutdown <config_instant_shutdown>` is ``True``
- ``session.shut_down(force=True)`` was called
- ``session.shut_down()`` was called twice
