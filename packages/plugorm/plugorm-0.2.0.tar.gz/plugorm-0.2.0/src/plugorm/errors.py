"""Custom exception classes for drivers and toolchains.

This module defines all error types raised during parsing, execution, and toolchain operations. Errors are grouped by
their purpose, including internal language (IL) parsing, SQL dialect translation, execution failures, and result
simplification issues. It also includes validation and synchronous/asynchronous capability errors.

``LinkValidationError``:
    Raised when step input/output sets are incompatible.
``ILParsingError``:
    Raised when parsing the internal language fails.
``DialectParsingError``:
    Raised when converting IL to a SQL dialect fails.
``ExecutionError``:
    Raised when executing a SQL statement fails.
``SimplifyingError``:
    Raised when simplifying low-level results fails.
``NotAsyncError``:
    Raised when async execution is attempted but not supported.
``NotSyncError``:
    Raised when sync execution is attempted but not supported.
