"""Toolchain step definitions.

This module defines the building blocks of a toolchain, where each step wraps a driver or processor (internal language
driver, connection driver, or simplifier) and provides both synchronous and asynchronous execution methods with
integrated logging for start, success, and error events.

Step:
    Base class for toolchain steps that resolves the underlying driver.

ILStep:
    Wraps an internal language driver for parsing input into SQL dialects.

ConnectionStep:
    Wraps a connection driver for executing SQL statements.

SimplifierStep:
    Wraps a simplifier for post-processing and simplifying results.
