"""The filters package provides modules for applying transformations to raster data.

It includes spatial filters (e.g., smoothing) as well as spectral filters (e.g., band math).
Main idea is to further manipulate the objects such as merging segments or applying pre-defined rules to filter objects
based on their attributes.
