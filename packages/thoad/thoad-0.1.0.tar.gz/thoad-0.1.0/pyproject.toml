description = "**thoad** (Torch High Order Automatic Differentiation) is a lightweight reverse-mode autodifferentiation engine written entirely in Python that works over PyTorch’s computational graph to compute **high order partial derivatives**. Unlike PyTorch’s native autograd - which is limited to first-order native partial derivatives - **thoad** is able to performantly propagate arbitray-order derivatives throughout the graph, enabling more advanced gradient-based computations."
