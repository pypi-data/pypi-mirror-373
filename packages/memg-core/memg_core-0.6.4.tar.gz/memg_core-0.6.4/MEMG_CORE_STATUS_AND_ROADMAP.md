## üî¥ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS & ACTIVE ISSUES**

### **1. Partial Memory Creation on Schema Validation Failure** ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTIVE**

**What Happens**: When you create a memory, it gets saved to Qdrant (vector database) first, then to Kuzu (graph database). If the Kuzu save fails due to schema validation errors, the memory remains in Qdrant but not in Kuzu.

**Real Example**:
```python
add_memory("task", {"statement": "test", "invalid_field": "bad"}, "user")
# Result: Memory saved in Qdrant ‚úÖ, but Kuzu save fails ‚ùå
# Now you have orphaned data in Qdrant that shows up in searches
```

**Why It's Bad**:
- Search finds memories that don't exist in the graph
- Data inconsistency between storage systems
- Duplicate attempts create more orphaned records

**Current Workaround**: Always validate your payload matches the YAML schema before calling add_memory

**Fix Needed**: Implement atomic transactions - if either storage fails, rollback both

### **2. YAML Schema Design Ambiguities** üü° **MINOR**

**What's Confusing**: In YAML relationship definitions, it's unclear if `directed: true` applies to all predicates in a list.

**Real Example from Schema**:
```yaml
relations:
  bug:
    - name: bug_relationships
      predicates: [FIXES, ADDRESSES, RESOLVES]  # Multiple predicates
      directed: true  # ‚Üê Does this make ALL three predicates directed?
```

**The Problem**:
- Does `FIXES` work both ways (A fixes B, B fixed-by A)?
- Or is it one-way only (A fixes B, but not B fixes A)?
- Same confusion for `ADDRESSES` and `RESOLVES`

**Why It Matters**: Graph traversal and relationship queries depend on direction

**Fix Needed**: Clarify in documentation whether `directed` applies to all predicates or needs individual specification

### **3. Relationship `name` Field Underutilization** üü° **MINOR**

**What's the Issue**: Every relationship definition has a `name` field, but it's not clear what it's used for.

**Real Example from Schema**:
```yaml
relations:
  task:
    - name: task_blocks_task          # ‚Üê What is this name used for?
      description: "Task blocking another task"
      predicate: BLOCKS               # ‚Üê This is what actually matters
      directed: true
```

**The Confusion**:
- Is `name` just a comment/documentation?
- Does the system use `name` for anything functional?
- Should it match the `predicate` or can it be anything?

**Why It's Annoying**:
- Schema files get bloated with potentially useless names
- Unclear naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase vs whatever)
- Maintenance burden - if you change predicate, do you change name?

**Fix Needed**: Either make `name` functional (use it for something) or remove it entirely

## üöÄ **UPCOMING FEATURES ROADMAP**

### **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Phase 3**

#### **1. Access Control & User Scoping** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

**Problem**: Any user can edit any memory by changing user_id parameter.

**Solution**: Implement memory-level permissions:
- `owner`: Full CRUD access
- `collaborator`: Read + relationship creation
- `viewer`: Read-only access

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
# Add permission checking to all operations
def update_memory(hrid, payload, user_id, requester_id):
    permissions = get_memory_permissions(hrid, requester_id)
    if 'write' not in permissions:
        raise PermissionError("Insufficient permissions")
```

**Benefits**: Multi-user security, collaboration workflows

#### **2. Bulk Operations Support** ‚≠ê **HIGH**

**Problem**: No efficient way to handle multiple memories/relationships for ETL processes.

**Solution**:
- `bulk_add_memories(memories_list)` - Batch memory creation
- `bulk_update_memories(updates_list)` - Batch updates with rollback
- `bulk_add_relationships(relationships_list)` - Efficient relationship creation
- `bulk_delete_memories(hrids_list)` - Batch deletion with dependency checking

**Benefits**: ETL processes, data migration, performance optimization

#### **3. Enhanced Search & Filtering** ‚≠ê **HIGH**

**Problem**: Limited search filtering and sorting options for dashboard use cases.

**Solution**:
- Date range filtering (`created_after`, `updated_before`)
- Multiple memory type filtering (`types=["task", "bug"]`)
- Field-based filtering (`filters={"status": "open", "priority": "high"}`)
- Advanced sorting (relevance, date, custom fields)
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets

**Implementation**:
```python
def get_memories(
    user_id: str,
    memory_types: list[str] = None,
    filters: dict = None,
    date_range: dict = None,
    sort_by: str = "created_at",
    sort_order: str = "desc",
    limit: int = 50,
    cursor: str = None
) -> dict:
```

### **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Phase 4**

#### **4. Memory Type Inference Enhancement** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM**

**Current**: Relationship operations require explicit memory types
**Improvement**: Make memory types optional, infer from HRID format

```python
def infer_memory_type(hrid: str) -> str:
    """DOCUMENT_AAA001 ‚Üí document"""
    return hrid.split('_')[0].lower()
```

**Benefits**: Cleaner API, reduced verbosity

#### **5. Relationship Inheritance System** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM**

**Problem**: No relationship inheritance from parent entities.

**Solution**: Optional inheritance with schema control:
```yaml
relations:
  memo:
    - name: memo_related
      predicate: RELATED_TO
      inherit: true  # Child entities inherit this relationship
```

**Benefits**: Reduced schema duplication, consistent relationship patterns

#### **6. Advanced Graph Operations** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM**

**Features**:
- Multi-hop relationship queries with path constraints
- Shortest path finding between memories
- Relationship strength/weight scoring
- Graph analytics (centrality, clustering)

### **üîµ LOWER PRIORITY - Future Phases**

#### **7. Schema Evolution & Migration** ‚≠ê **LOW**

**Features**:
- Schema versioning and backward compatibility
- Automatic data migration tools
- Schema validation and conflict detection
- Field deprecation and removal strategies

#### **8. Performance & Scalability** ‚≠ê **LOW**

**Features**:
- Query optimization and caching
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Memory usage optimization
- Background indexing and maintenance
