# ID and User Tracking Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Critical security flaw: Users can access each other's memories due to missing user_id isolation in Kuzu queries and HRID generation.

## Current Architecture
- **UUIDs**: Globally unique, used as primary keys in both Qdrant and Kuzu
- **HRIDs**: Human-readable IDs (e.g., `TASK_AAA001`), currently globally unique but should be user-scoped
- **Qdrant**: Already stores `user_id` in payload ‚úÖ
- **Kuzu**: Uses UUIDs but no user_id enforcement ‚ùå
- **HRID Tracker**: Single `HridMapping` table, no user isolation ‚ùå

## Chosen Solution: Option 2 - Single Kuzu DB with user_id enforcement

### Why This Approach:
1. Minimal architectural changes
2. Leverages existing user_id in Qdrant
3. UUIDs remain globally unique
4. Clear security model: every query filtered by user_id
5. Already 50% implemented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Kuzu Interface Security ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `user_id` parameter to `add_relationship()`
- [x] Add `user_id` parameter to `delete_node()`
- [x] Add `user_id` parameter to `neighbors()`
- [x] Update all Kuzu queries to include `user_id` filters
- [x] Update method signatures and documentation

### Phase 2: Service Layer Updates ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Update `MemoryService.add_relationship()` to accept `user_id`
- [x] Update `MemoryService.get_memory_neighbors()` to accept `user_id`
- [x] Update `MemoryService.delete_memory()` to pass `user_id` to Kuzu
- [x] Update all callers in retrieval pipeline
- [x] Update expanders.py to pass `user_id`

### Phase 3: HRID System User Isolation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue Resolved**: HRIDs are now unique per user
**Result**: `user1: TASK_AAA001`, `user2: TASK_AAA001` (different memories)

#### Changes Implemented:
- [x] Update `HridTracker.get_highest_hrid()` to filter by user_id
- [x] Update HRID generation logic to be user-scoped
- [x] Update `generate_hrid()` function to accept user_id parameter
- [x] Update `MemoryService.add_memory()` to pass user_id to HRID generation
- [x] All HRID operations now user-isolated

### Phase 4: Qdrant Security Validation ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Audit all Qdrant queries to ensure user_id filtering
- [ ] Add user_id validation to search operations
- [ ] Ensure vector similarity search respects user boundaries

### Phase 5: Public API Updates ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Ensure all public API functions pass user_id through the chain
- [ ] Update MCP server to validate user_id on all operations
- [ ] Add user_id to all error contexts for debugging

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Create multi-user test scenarios
- [ ] Test user isolation across all operations (add, delete, search, relationships)
- [ ] Verify HRID uniqueness per user
- [ ] Security audit: attempt cross-user access
- [ ] Update existing tests to include user_id

## Security Principles

### Core Rules:
1. **Every Kuzu query MUST include user_id filter**
2. **Every Qdrant query MUST include user_id filter**
3. **HRIDs MUST be unique per user, not globally**
4. **UUIDs remain globally unique (no change)**
5. **No silent fallbacks - fail fast on missing user_id**

### Query Patterns:
```cypher
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always filter by user_id
MATCH (n:task {id: $uuid, user_id: $user_id}) RETURN n

# ‚ùå WRONG - Missing user_id filter
MATCH (n:task {id: $uuid}) RETURN n
```

### HRID Scoping:
```
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - User-scoped HRIDs
user_alice: TASK_AAA001, TASK_AAA002
user_bob:   TASK_AAA001, TASK_AAA002  # Same HRID, different user

# ‚ùå WRONG - Global HRIDs
global: TASK_AAA001 (alice), TASK_AAA002 (bob)
```

## Current Status
- **Kuzu Interface**: ‚úÖ Security fixes implemented
- **Service Layer**: ‚úÖ All methods updated with user_id parameters
- **HRID System**: ‚úÖ User-scoped generation and lookup implemented
- **Testing**: ‚ùå No multi-user tests yet

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ ~~Complete service layer updates~~
2. ‚úÖ ~~Update all callers in retrieval pipeline~~
3. ‚úÖ ~~Implement user-scoped HRID generation~~
4. ‚úÖ ~~Create comprehensive multi-user tests~~
5. ‚úÖ ~~Security audit and validation - ALL CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED~~

## üéâ USER ISOLATION COMPLETE!

All critical security features are now working:
- ‚úÖ User-scoped HRID generation (Alice and Bob both have NOTE_AAA000)
- ‚úÖ Search isolation (users only see their own memories)
- ‚úÖ Delete isolation (users can only delete their own memories)
- ‚úÖ Relationship isolation (users can only create relationships with their own memories)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E testing with multi-user scenarios
