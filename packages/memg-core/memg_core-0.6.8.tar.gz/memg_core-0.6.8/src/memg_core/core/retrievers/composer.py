"""Result composition utilities for enhanced search results.

NOTE: This file contains legacy functions that are no longer used in the
consolidated search pipeline. The new pipeline directly creates SearchResult
objects in retrieval.py without needing these composition utilities.

All functions have been removed as they are not compatible with the new
single SearchResult format and are not used anywhere in the codebase.
