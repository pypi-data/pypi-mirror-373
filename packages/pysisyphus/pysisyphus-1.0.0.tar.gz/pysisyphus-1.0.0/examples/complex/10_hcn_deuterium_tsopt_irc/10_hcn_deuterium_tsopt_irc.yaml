 # Use deuterium instead of hydrogen. isotopes should be a list of pairs, with
 # the first item in the pair denoting the atom index (0-based) and the second
 # item is either an integer (approximate mass) or a flaot. If it is a float is
 # directly used as mass. If it is an integer it will be interpreted as approximate
 # mass and a corresponding (exact) isotope mass will be selected from an internal
 # database (ISOTOPE_DICT in elem_data.py).
 #
 # Below, we use a different isotope for the hydrogen atom (index 2):
 isotopes: [[2, 2]]
 #isotopes: [[2, 2.014101778]]
 # Both lines give identical results. In the second line the mass is given directly.
