     # List of restraints; could also be multiple restraints. Each restraint is given as
     # list of 2 or 3 items. The first item always specifies an internal coordinate,
     # whereas the second argument is a force constant (in atomic units; actual units
     # depend on the coordinate). Optionally a reference value (third argument) can be
     # given. If omitted, the initial coordinate value is used as reference value.

     # Multiple restraints are specified as given below. As H2 has only two atoms
     # this input would be invalid.
