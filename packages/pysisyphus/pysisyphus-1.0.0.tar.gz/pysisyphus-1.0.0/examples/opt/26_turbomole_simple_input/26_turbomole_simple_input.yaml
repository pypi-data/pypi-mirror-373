 # Turbomole's simple input is given as nested dictionaries.
 # The 'basis' key is mandatory and must be given on the top level
 # Other keys on the top level are translated into separate data groups.
 # The input below will result in the data groups
 # $dft
 #  ...
 # $rij
 # $disp4
 #
 # Every data group can have (several) child options/keywords. See below
 # for various examples. If an option is just a keyword without further arguments, e.g.,
 # 'weight derivatives' then any further input can be omitted.
