[CDF-25595] üêõ Set nonce function schedules (#1891)

# Description

Instead of letting the `cognite-sdk` set the credentials, we create the
session first and set the `nonce`. This ensures that function schedules
follows the same pattern we use for transformations.

This requires updating the `cognite-sdk` which leads to a few tests
needs update, and found the issue with workflow trigger described below.

## Changelog

### Improved

- When deploying a function schedule, if the credentials are invalid,

performance boost.

### Fixed

specified that is unchanged.
