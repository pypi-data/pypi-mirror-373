## Algorithmic Contributions

### FOIL (First Order Inductive Learner)
FOIL employs a top-down, separate-and-conquer approach to learning first-order logic rules:

#### Core Algorithm Components
- **Information Gain Heuristic**: Selects literals that maximize the information gained about positive examples
- **Greedy Search**: Constructs rules by iteratively adding literals that improve classification
- **Pruning Mechanisms**: Eliminates unpromising branches early to maintain efficiency
- **Significance Testing**: Validates learned rules using statistical significance measures

#### Mathematical Foundation
The information gain for adding a literal L to a partial rule R is calculated as:
```
Gain(L) = t * (log2(p1/(p1+n1)) - log2(p0/(p0+n0)))
```
Where:
- t = number of positive examples covered by R∧L
- p1, n1 = positive and negative examples covered by R∧L  
- p0, n0 = positive and negative examples covered by R

### Progol (PROgramming in LOGic)
Progol uses inverse entailment and mode-directed search for efficient ILP:

#### Core Algorithm Components
- **Bottom Clause Construction**: Generates most specific clause that entails positive example
- **Mode Declarations**: Constrain search space using input/output variable modes
- **Compression Metric**: Evaluates hypotheses based on description length reduction
- **Clause Refinement**: Systematically searches through refinement lattice

#### Inverse Entailment Framework
Given background knowledge B and example e, Progol constructs:
```
⊥ = {L | B ∧ ¬L ⊨ ¬e}
```
This bottom clause ⊥ represents the most specific generalization that explains e.

### Key Theoretical Contributions

#### Learning Framework
- **Hypothesis Space**: First-order logic clauses with limited complexity
- **Search Strategy**: Combination of top-down (FOIL) and bottom-up (Progol) approaches  
- **Completeness**: Systematic exploration ensures all solutions within bounds are found
- **Complexity Control**: Parameters limit clause length, variable count, and search depth

#### Rule Quality Metrics
- **Coverage**: Proportion of positive examples explained by rule
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of examples correctly classified by rule
- **Compression**: Reduction in total description length
- **Significance**: Statistical confidence in learned patterns
