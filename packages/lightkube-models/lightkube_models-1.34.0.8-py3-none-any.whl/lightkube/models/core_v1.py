      * **envFrom** ``Optional[List[EnvFromSource]]`` - List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source may consist of any printable ASCII characters except
        '='. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last
        source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key
        will take precedence. Cannot be updated.
      * **image** ``Optional[str]`` - Container image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional
        to allow higher level config management to default or override container
        images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
      * **imagePullPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if
        :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More
        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
      * **lifecycle** ``Optional[Lifecycle]`` - Actions that the management system should take in response to container
        lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.
      * **livenessProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe
        fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **ports** ``Optional[List[ContainerPort]]`` - List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES
        NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
        default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the
        network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data.
        For more information See
        https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated.
      * **readinessProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from
        service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **resizePolicy** ``Optional[List[ContainerResizePolicy]]`` - Resources resize policy for the container.
      * **resources** ``Optional[ResourceRequirements]`` - Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
      * **restartPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
        This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container
        type. Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init
        container will have the following effect: this init container will be
        continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated.
        Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with
        restartPolicy "Always" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal
        init containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although
        this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not
        wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init
        container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.
      * **restartPolicyRules** ``Optional[List[ContainerRestartRule]]`` - Represents a list of rules to be checked to determine if the container should
        be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches a
        container exit condition, the remaining rules are ignored. If no rule matches
        the container exit condition, the Container-level restart policy determines
        the whether the container is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules: - At
        most 20 rules are allowed. - Rules can have the same action. - Identical rules
        are not forbidden in validations. When rules are specified, container MUST set
        RestartPolicy explicitly even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.
      * **securityContext** ``Optional[SecurityContext]`` - SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
        If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of
        PodSecurityContext. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
      * **startupProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If
        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If
        this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe
        failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the
        beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or
        warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **stdin** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always
        result in EOF. Default is false.
      * **stdinOnce** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been
        opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is
        opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin,
        and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which
        time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If
        this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never
        receive an EOF. Default is false
      * **terminationMessagePath** ``Optional[str]`` - Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
        will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is
        intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will
        be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length
        across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
      * **terminationMessagePolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
        contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on
        both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of
        container log output if the termination message file is empty and the
        container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
      * **tty** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin'
        to be true. Default is false.
      * **volumeDevices** ``Optional[List[VolumeDevice]]`` - volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
      * **volumeMounts** ``Optional[List[VolumeMount]]`` - Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.
      * **workingDir** ``Optional[str]`` - Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot
        be updated.

      ephemeral container causes the Pod to exceed its resource allocation.
      
      To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an
      existing Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

      **parameters**

      * **name** ``str`` - Name of the ephemeral container specified as a DNS_LABEL. This name must be
        unique among all containers, init containers and ephemeral containers.
      * **args** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - Arguments to the entrypoint. The image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
        Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
        environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
        string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows
        for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the
        string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded,
        regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
      * **command** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The image's ENTRYPOINT is used
        if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using
        the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference
        in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $,
        which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
        produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be
        expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
      * **env** ``Optional[List[EnvVar]]`` - List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.
      * **envFrom** ``Optional[List[EnvFromSource]]`` - List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source may consist of any printable ASCII characters except
        '='. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last
        source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key
        will take precedence. Cannot be updated.
      * **image** ``Optional[str]`` - Container image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
      * **imagePullPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if
        :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More
        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
      * **lifecycle** ``Optional[Lifecycle]`` - Lifecycle is not allowed for ephemeral containers.
      * **livenessProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
      * **ports** ``Optional[List[ContainerPort]]`` - Ports are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
      * **readinessProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
      * **resizePolicy** ``Optional[List[ContainerResizePolicy]]`` - Resources resize policy for the container.
      * **resources** ``Optional[ResourceRequirements]`` - Resources are not allowed for ephemeral containers. Ephemeral containers use
        spare resources already allocated to the pod.
      * **restartPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Restart policy for the container to manage the restart behavior of each
        container within a pod. You cannot set this field on ephemeral containers.
      * **restartPolicyRules** ``Optional[List[ContainerRestartRule]]`` - Represents a list of rules to be checked to determine if the container should
        be restarted on exit. You cannot set this field on ephemeral containers.
      * **securityContext** ``Optional[SecurityContext]`` - Optional: SecurityContext defines the security options the ephemeral container
        should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the
        equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
      * **startupProbe** ``Optional[Probe]`` - Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
      * **stdin** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always
        result in EOF. Default is false.
      * **stdinOnce** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been
        opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is
        opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin,
        and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which
        time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If
        this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never
        receive an EOF. Default is false
      * **targetContainerName** ``Optional[str]`` - If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this ephemeral container
        targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces (IPC, PID, etc)
        of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container uses the namespaces
        configured in the Pod spec.
        The container runtime must implement support for this feature. If the runtime
        does not support namespace targeting then the result of setting this field is
        undefined.
      * **terminationMessagePath** ``Optional[str]`` - Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
        will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is
        intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will
        be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length
        across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
      * **terminationMessagePolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
        contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on
        both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of
        container log output if the termination message file is empty and the
        container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
      * **tty** ``Optional[bool]`` - Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin'
        to be true. Default is false.
      * **volumeDevices** ``Optional[List[VolumeDevice]]`` - volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
      * **volumeMounts** ``Optional[List[VolumeMount]]`` - Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Subpath mounts are not
        allowed for ephemeral containers. Cannot be updated.
      * **workingDir** ``Optional[str]`` - Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot
        be updated.

        LastKnownGood config, depending on whether attempting to use the Assigned
        config results in an error.
      * **assigned** ``Optional[NodeConfigSource]`` - Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When
        Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config
        payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The
        node refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this
        record in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has
        been checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the
        Assigned config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed
        payload identified by Assigned.
      * **error** ``Optional[str]`` - Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active
        config. Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint
        Spec.ConfigSource to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint the
        payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the
        Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at different points while syncing
        config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors) will not result
        in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later
        errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a
        rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to
        resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can
        find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in
        the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the error state;

        Assigned config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a
        10-minute soak period starting when the local record of Assigned config is
        updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it
        becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use
        local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because
        the local default config is always assumed good. You should not make
        assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability and

        object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC
        (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can
        support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the
        contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature
        gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and
        dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when
        dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then
        dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.
      * **dataSourceRef** ``Optional[TypedObjectReference]`` - dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with
        data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a
        non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When
        this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the
        specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
        provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field
        and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
        backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both
        fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
        automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When
        namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same
        value and must be empty. There are three important differences between
        dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific
        types of objects, dataSourceRef
          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
          specified.
        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
          in any namespaces.
        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be
        enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the
        CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
      * **resources** ``Optional[VolumeResourceRequirements]`` - resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If
        RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify
        resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be

      * **selector** ``Optional[meta_v1.LabelSelector]`` - selector is a label query over volumes to consider for binding.
      * **storageClassName** ``Optional[str]`` - storageClassName is the name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More
        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1
      * **volumeAttributesClassName** ``Optional[str]`` - volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by
        this claim. If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with
        the attributes defined in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a
        different purpose than storageClassName, it can be changed after the claim is
        created. An empty string or nil value indicates that no VolumeAttributesClass
        will be applied to the claim. If the claim enters an Infeasible error state,
        this field can be reset to its previous value (including nil) to cancel the
        modification. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not
        exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected

        either:
        	* Un-prefixed keys:
        		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
        	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as
        "example.com/my-custom-resource"
        Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io
        prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.
        ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:

        		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in
        control-plane.
        	- ControllerResizeFailed:

        	- NodeResizePending:
        		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but

        		volume is needed on the node.
        	- NodeResizeInProgress:
        		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
        	- NodeResizeFailed:
        		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error.
        Transient errors don't set
        		NodeResizeFailed.
        For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of
        the following states:
        	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] =
        "ControllerResizeInProgress"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] =

             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
        When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress
        for the given PVC.
        A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or
        ClaimResourceStatus should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed.
        For example - a controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of
        the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources
        associated with PVC.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure
        feature.
      * **allocatedResources** ``Optional[dict]`` - allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its
        capacity. Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are
        either:
        	* Un-prefixed keys:
        		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
        	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as
        "example.com/my-custom-resource"
        Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io
        prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.
        Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume
        expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from
        allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is
        not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume
        expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if
        there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume
        capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity.
        A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
        should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a
        controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume,

        Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384", "ECDSAP521",

      * **certificateChainPath** ``Optional[str]`` - Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.
        Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath and
        certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key and leaf
        certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the files
        mid-rotation.
      * **credentialBundlePath** ``Optional[str]`` - Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.
        The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks. The
        first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private key.
        The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued certificate
        chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).
        Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
        atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
        project them to separate files, your application code will need to
        additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.
      * **keyPath** ``Optional[str]`` - Write the key at this path in the projected volume.
        Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath and
        certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key and leaf
        certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the files
        mid-rotation.
      * **maxExpirationSeconds** ``Optional[int]`` - maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the certificate.
        Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
        generates for this projection.
        If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver will
        reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable value is
        7862400 (91 days).
        The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
        lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600 seconds
        (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver. `kubernetes.io`

      PodSecurityContext.

      **parameters**

      * **appArmorProfile** ``Optional[AppArmorProfile]`` - appArmorProfile is the AppArmor options to use by the containers in this pod.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **fsGroup** ``Optional[int]`` - A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some
        volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be
        owned by the pod:
        1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files
        created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are
        OR'd with rw-rw----
        If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any
        volume. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **fsGroupChangePolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of
        the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
        volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will
        have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and
        emptydir. Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified,
        "Always" is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
      * **runAsGroup** ``Optional[int]`` - The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default
        if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext
        and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes
        precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when
        spec.os.name is windows.
      * **runAsNonRoot** ``Optional[bool]`` - Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet
        will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
        (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
        validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in
        both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence.
      * **runAsUser** ``Optional[int]`` - The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in
        SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the
        value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note
        that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **seLinuxChangePolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to
        all volumes used by the Pod. It has no effect on nodes that do not support
        SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux. Valid values are "MountOption"
        and "Recursive".
        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container
        runtime. This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and
        unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.
        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux
        label. It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and
        unprivileged Pods. Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI
        volumes, and all CSI volumes whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by
        setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are
        always re-labelled recursively. "MountOption" value is allowed only when
        SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.
        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is
        used. If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled,
        "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes and "Recursive" for all
        other volumes.
        This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in
        PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.
        All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy,
        otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state. Note that this
        field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **seLinuxOptions** ``Optional[SELinuxOptions]`` - The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified, the
        container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
        for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
      * **seccompProfile** ``Optional[SeccompProfile]`` - The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod. Note that this field
        cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **supplementalGroups** ``Optional[List[int]]`` - A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in
        addition to the container's primary GID and fsGroup (if specified).  If the
        SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature is enabled, the supplementalGroupsPolicy
        field determines whether these are in addition to or instead of any group
        memberships defined in the container image. If unspecified, no additional
        groups are added, though group memberships defined in the container image may
        still be used, depending on the supplementalGroupsPolicy field. Note that this
        field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **supplementalGroupsPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Defines how supplemental groups of the first container processes are
        calculated. Valid values are "Merge" and "Strict". If not specified, "Merge"
        is used. (Alpha) Using the field requires the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature
        gate to be enabled and the container runtime must implement support for this
        feature. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **sysctls** ``Optional[List[Sysctl]]`` - Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with
        unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch. Note that
        this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **windowsOptions** ``Optional[WindowsSecurityContextOptions]`` - The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the
        options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        linux.

        list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by
        updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an existing
        pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource.
      * **hostAliases** ``Optional[List[HostAlias]]`` - HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into
        the pod's hosts file if specified.
      * **hostIPC** ``Optional[bool]`` - Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.
      * **hostNetwork** ``Optional[bool]`` - Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace. When
        using HostNetwork you should specify ports so the scheduler is aware. When
        `hostNetwork` is true, specified `hostPort` fields in port definitions must
        match `containerPort`, and unspecified `hostPort` fields in port definitions
        are defaulted to match `containerPort`. Default to false.
      * **hostPID** ``Optional[bool]`` - Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.

      * **initContainers** ``Optional[List[Container]]`` - List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are
        executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container
        fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its
        restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
        unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions,
        Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements
        of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the
        highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of that
        value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init
        containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or

        enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass
        admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead
        already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec,
        Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass,
        otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md
      * **preemptionPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of
        Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
      * **priority** ``Optional[int]`` - The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
        priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it
        prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates
        this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the
        priority.
      * **priorityClassName** ``Optional[str]`` - If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and
        "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest
        priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be
        defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified,
        the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
      * **readinessGates** ``Optional[List[PodReadinessGate]]`` - If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod
        is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the
        readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates
      * **resourceClaims** ``Optional[List[PodResourceClaim]]`` - ResourceClaims defines which ResourceClaims must be allocated and reserved
        before the Pod is allowed to start. The resources will be made available to
        those containers which consume them by name.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
        feature gate.
        This field is immutable.
      * **resources** ``Optional[ResourceRequirements]`` - Resources is the total amount of CPU and Memory resources required by all
        containers in the pod. It supports specifying Requests and Limits for "cpu",
        "memory" and "hugepages-" resource names only. ResourceClaims are not
        supported.
        This field enables fine-grained control over resource allocation for the
        entire pod, allowing resource sharing among containers in a pod.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling the PodLevelResources feature
        gate.
      * **restartPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure,
        Never. In some contexts, only a subset of those values may be permitted.
        Default to Always. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
      * **runtimeClassName** ``Optional[str]`` - RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group,
        which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the
        named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy"
        RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition
        that uses the default runtime handler. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class
      * **schedulerName** ``Optional[str]`` - If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
        specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
      * **schedulingGates** ``Optional[List[PodSchedulingGate]]`` - SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block
        scheduling the pod. If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the
        SchedulingGated state and the scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod.
        SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation time, and be removed only
        afterwards.
      * **securityContext** ``Optional[PodSecurityContext]`` - SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container
        settings. Optional: Defaults to empty.  See type description for default
        values of each field.
      * **serviceAccount** ``Optional[str]`` - DeprecatedServiceAccount is a deprecated alias for ServiceAccountName.
        Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
      * **serviceAccountName** ``Optional[str]`` - ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
      * **setHostnameAsFQDN** ``Optional[bool]`` - If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than
        the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN
        in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In
        Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the
        registry key
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters to
        FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
      * **shareProcessNamespace** ``Optional[bool]`` - Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When
        this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other
        containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not
        be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set.
        Optional: Default to false.
      * **subdomain** ``Optional[str]`` - If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
        "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not
        specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
      * **terminationGracePeriodSeconds** ``Optional[int]`` - Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be
        decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
        zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut
        down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead.
        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the
        pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly
        halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup
        time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
      * **tolerations** ``Optional[List[Toleration]]`` - If specified, the pod's tolerations.
      * **topologySpreadConstraints** ``Optional[List[TopologySpreadConstraint]]`` - TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across
        topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the
        constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.
      * **volumes** ``Optional[List[Volume]]`` - List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More

      **parameters**

      * **conditions** ``Optional[List[PodCondition]]`` - Current service state of pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-conditions
      * **containerStatuses** ``Optional[List[ContainerStatus]]`` - Statuses of containers in this pod. Each container in the pod should have at
        most one status in this list, and all statuses should be for containers in the
        pod. However this is not enforced. If a status for a non-existent container is

        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status
      * **ephemeralContainerStatuses** ``Optional[List[ContainerStatus]]`` - Statuses for any ephemeral containers that have run in this pod. Each
        ephemeral container in the pod should have at most one status in this list,
        and all statuses should be for containers in the pod. However this is not
        enforced. If a status for a non-existent container is present in the list, or

      * **extendedResourceClaimStatus** ``Optional[PodExtendedResourceClaimStatus]`` - Status of extended resource claim backed by DRA.
      * **hostIP** ``Optional[str]`` - hostIP holds the IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if
        the pod has not started yet. A pod can be assigned to a node that has a
        problem in kubelet which in turns mean that HostIP will not be updated even if
        there is a node is assigned to pod
      * **hostIPs** ``Optional[List[HostIP]]`` - hostIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the host. If this field is
        specified, the first entry must match the hostIP field. This list is empty if
        the pod has not started yet. A pod can be assigned to a node that has a
        problem in kubelet which in turns means that HostIPs will not be updated even
        if there is a node is assigned to this pod.
      * **initContainerStatuses** ``Optional[List[ContainerStatus]]`` - Statuses of init containers in this pod. The most recent successful
        non-restartable init container will have ready = true, the most recently
        started container will have startTime set. Each init container in the pod
        should have at most one status in this list, and all statuses should be for
        containers in the pod. However this is not enforced. If a status for a

        statuses might be ignored. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-and-container-status
      * **message** ``Optional[str]`` - A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        condition.
      * **nominatedNodeName** ``Optional[str]`` - nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node,
        but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their
        graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod will
        be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if
        other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the
        resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after
        preemption. As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName
        when the pod is scheduled.
      * **observedGeneration** ``Optional[int]`` - If set, this represents the .metadata.generation that the pod status was set
        based upon. This is an alpha field. Enable PodObservedGenerationTracking to be
        able to use this field.
      * **phase** ``Optional[str]`` - The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
        lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the
        individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
        There are five possible phase values:
        Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more
        of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being
        scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which
        could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the
        containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is
        in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod
        have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers
        in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in
        failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by
        the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be
        obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase
      * **podIP** ``Optional[str]`` - podIP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster.
        Empty if not yet allocated.
      * **podIPs** ``Optional[List[PodIP]]`` - podIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the pod. If this field is
        specified, the 0th entry must match the podIP field. Pods may be allocated at
        most 1 value for each of IPv4 and IPv6. This list is empty if no IPs have been
        allocated yet.
      * **qosClass** ``Optional[str]`` - The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on
        resource requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#quality-of-service-classes
      * **reason** ``Optional[str]`` - A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        state. e.g. 'Evicted'
      * **resize** ``Optional[str]`` - Status of resources resize desired for pod's containers. It is empty if no
        resources resize is pending. Any changes to container resources will
        automatically set this to "Proposed" Deprecated: Resize status is moved to two
        pod conditions PodResizePending and PodResizeInProgress. PodResizePending will
        track states where the spec has been resized, but the Kubelet has not yet
        allocated the resources. PodResizeInProgress will track in-progress resizes,
        and should be present whenever allocated resources != acknowledged resources.
      * **resourceClaimStatuses** ``Optional[List[PodResourceClaimStatus]]`` - Status of resource claims.
      * **startTime** ``Optional[meta_v1.Time]`` - RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet.
        This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.

        * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as
        mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
      * **name** ``Optional[str]`` - The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports
        within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints
        for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional
        if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
      * **nodePort** ``Optional[int]`` - The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort
        or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified,
        in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.

class ServiceSpec(DictMixin):
    r"""ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

      **parameters**

      * **allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts** ``Optional[bool]`` - allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automatically
        allocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is "true". It may be
        set to "false" if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts.  If

        will be respected, regardless of this field. This field may only be set for
        services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to
        any other type.
      * **clusterIP** ``Optional[str]`` - clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly.
        If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system
        configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service;

        assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per
        system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service;
        otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed
        through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName
        (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed

        will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type
        ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will be initialized from the
        clusterIP field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure that
        clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value.
        This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either
        order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both
        clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
      * **externalIPs** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also
        accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.
        The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this
        IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the
        Kubernetes system.
      * **externalName** ``Optional[str]`` - externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return
        as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be
        involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname
        (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires `type` to be
        "ExternalName".
      * **externalTrafficPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
        receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
        ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will
        configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will
        take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node
        will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without
        masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no
        endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard
        behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and
        other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP
        from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients
        sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy
        into account when picking a node.
      * **healthCheckNodePort** ``Optional[int]`` - healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This
        only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set
        to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be
        used.  If not specified, a value will be automatically allocated.  External
        systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if a given node
        holds endpoints for this service or not.  If this field is specified when
        creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will
        be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).
        This field cannot be updated once set.
      * **internalTrafficPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
        receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
        only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
        dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
        "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
        (possibly modified by topology and other features).
      * **ipFamilies** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
        service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
        configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified
        manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy
        allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This
        field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary
        IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the
        Service. Valid values are "IPv4" and "IPv6".  This field only applies to
        Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to
        "headless" services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type
        ExternalName.
        This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either
        order).  These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field,
        if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the
        ipFamilyPolicy field.
      * **ipFamilyPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this
        Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to
        SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family),
        "PreferDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a
        single IP family on single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack" (two IP
        families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies
        and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be
        wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
      * **loadBalancerClass** ``Optional[str]`` - loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this
        Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a
        label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. "internal-vip" or
        "example.com/internal-vip". Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This
        field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the
        default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done
        through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default
        implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is
        watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
        implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this
        field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type
        'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when
        a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
      * **loadBalancerIP** ``Optional[str]`` - Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer. This feature depends on whether
        the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a
        load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider
        does not support the feature. Deprecated: This field was under-specified and
        its meaning varies across implementations. Using it is non-portable and it may
        not support dual-stack. Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific
        annotations when available.
      * **loadBalancerSourceRanges** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through
        the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client
        IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the
        feature." More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
      * **ports** ``Optional[List[ServicePort]]`` - The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
      * **publishNotReadyAddresses** ``Optional[bool]`` - publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints
        for this Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready. The
        primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless
        Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer
        discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and
        EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints
        are considered "ready" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which
        consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or
        EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
      * **selector** ``Optional[dict]`` - Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this
        selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external
        process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies
        to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is
        ExternalName. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
      * **sessionAffinity** ``Optional[str]`` - Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable
        client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
      * **sessionAffinityConfig** ``Optional[SessionAffinityConfig]`` - sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity.
      * **trafficDistribution** ``Optional[str]`` - TrafficDistribution offers a way to express preferences for how traffic is
        distributed to Service endpoints. Implementations can use this field as a
        hint, but are not required to guarantee strict adherence. If the field is not
        set, the implementation will apply its default routing strategy. If set to
        "PreferClose", implementations should prioritize endpoints that are in the
        same zone.
      * **type** ``Optional[str]`` - type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
        options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ClusterIP"
        allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
        Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by
        manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If
        clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are
        published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on
        ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same
        endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an
        external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the
        same endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases this service to the
        specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName
        services. More info:

class TopologySpreadConstraint(DictMixin):
    r"""TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given
      topology.

      **parameters**

      * **maxSkew** ``int`` - MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When
        `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global
        minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an
        eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than
        MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
        with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum
        is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1,
        incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it
        onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate
        MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
        to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0
        is not allowed.
      * **topologyKey** ``str`` - TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider
        each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into
        each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also,
        we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is
        "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if
        TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that
        topology. It's a required field.
      * **whenUnsatisfiable** ``str`` - WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the
        spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to
        schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any
        location,
          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
          skew.
        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if
        every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some
        topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with
        the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |
        P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can
        only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be
        imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required
        field.
      * **labelSelector** ``Optional[meta_v1.LabelSelector]`` - LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label
        selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding
        topology domain.
      * **matchLabelKeys** ``Optional[List[str]]`` - MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
        spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to
        select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for
        the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys
        and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or
        empty list means only match against labelSelector.
        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread
        feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
      * **minDomains** ``Optional[int]`` - MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of
        eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod
        Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew
        is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology
        keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on
        scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than
        minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid
        values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable
        must be DoNotSchedule.
        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5
        and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3
        | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains),
        so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same
        labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if
        new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.
      * **nodeAffinityPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
        when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes
        matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore:
        nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the
        calculations.
        If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
      * **nodeTaintsPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod
        topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with
        tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. -
        Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.
        If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

      * **hostPath** ``Optional[HostPathVolumeSource]`` - hostPath represents a pre-existing file or directory on the host machine that
        is directly exposed to the container. This is generally used for system agents
        or other privileged things that are allowed to see the host machine. Most
        containers will NOT need this. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#hostpath
      * **image** ``Optional[ImageVolumeSource]`` - image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and
        mounted on the kubelet's host machine. The volume is resolved at pod startup
        depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:
        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container
        creation will fail If the pull fails. - Never: the kubelet never pulls the
        reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will
        fail if the reference isn't present. - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the
        reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the
        reference isn't present and the pull fails.
        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means
        that new remote content will become available on pod recreation. A failure to
        resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from
        starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using
        normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message. The
        types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the
        container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include
        all valid types supported by the container image field. The OCI object gets
        mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by
        merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images. The
        volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec). Sub
        path mounts for containers are not supported
        (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33. The field
        spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

      **parameters**

      * **clusterTrustBundle** ``Optional[ClusterTrustBundleProjection]`` - ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field of
        ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.
        Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.
        ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
        combination of signer name and a label selector.
        Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written into the
        pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block
        headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of
        certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order
        over time.
      * **configMap** ``Optional[ConfigMapProjection]`` - configMap information about the configMap data to project
      * **downwardAPI** ``Optional[DownwardAPIProjection]`` - downwardAPI information about the downwardAPI data to project
      * **podCertificate** ``Optional[PodCertificateProjection]`` - Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
        chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.
        Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a PodCertificateRequest to
        the named signer.  Once the signer approves the request and issues a
        certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and certificate chain to the pod
        filesystem.  The pod does not start until certificates have been issued for
        each podCertificate projected volume source in its spec.
        Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated by
        the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt timestamp.
        Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath field,
        or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and certificateChainPath fields.
        The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM entry is
        the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM entries are the
        certificate chain issued by the signer (typically, signers will return their
        certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).
        Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code can
        read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath, your
        application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide with a
        certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf certificate
        you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application will need to
        check for this condition, and re-read until they are consistent.
        The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it issues;
        consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to use the
        certificates it issues.
