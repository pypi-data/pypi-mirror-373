class HPAScalingRules(DictMixin):
    r"""HPAScalingRules configures the scaling behavior for one direction via scaling
      Policy Rules and a configurable metric tolerance.
      
      Scaling Policy Rules are applied after calculating DesiredReplicas from
      metrics for the HPA. They can limit the scaling velocity by specifying scaling
      policies. They can prevent flapping by specifying the stabilization window, so
      that the number of replicas is not set instantly, instead, the safest value
      from the stabilization window is chosen.
      
      The tolerance is applied to the metric values and prevents scaling too eagerly
      for small metric variations. (Note that setting a tolerance requires enabling
      the alpha HPAConfigurableTolerance feature gate.)

      **parameters**

      * **policies** ``Optional[List[HPAScalingPolicy]]`` - policies is a list of potential scaling polices which can be used during
        scaling. If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: allow doubling
        the number of pods, or an absolute change of 4 pods in a 15s window. - For
        scale down: allow all pods to be removed in a 15s window.
      * **selectPolicy** ``Optional[str]`` - selectPolicy is used to specify which policy should be used. If not set, the
        default value Max is used.
      * **stabilizationWindowSeconds** ``Optional[int]`` - stabilizationWindowSeconds is the number of seconds for which past
        recommendations should be considered while scaling up or scaling down.
        StabilizationWindowSeconds must be greater than or equal to zero and less than
        or equal to 3600 (one hour). If not set, use the default values: - For scale
        up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the
        stabilization window is 300 seconds long).
      * **tolerance** ``Optional[resource.Quantity]`` - tolerance is the tolerance on the ratio between the current and desired metric
        value under which no updates are made to the desired number of replicas (e.g.
        0.01 for 1%). Must be greater than or equal to zero. If not set, the default
        cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).
        For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of
        100Mi, and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively,
        scaling will be triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or
        exceeds 101Mi.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling the HPAConfigurableTolerance
        feature gate.
