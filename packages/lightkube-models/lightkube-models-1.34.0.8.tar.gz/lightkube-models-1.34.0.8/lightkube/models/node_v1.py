class Overhead(DictMixin):
    r"""Overhead structure represents the resource overhead associated with running a
      pod.

      **parameters**

@dataclass
class RuntimeClass(DictMixin):
    r"""RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster.
      The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run
      all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are manually defined by a user or
      cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible
      for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod.  For more
      details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/

      **parameters**

      * **handler** ``str`` - handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI
        implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are
        specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are
        available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every
        node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI
        runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in
        a pod. The Handler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123)
        requirements, and is immutable.
      * **apiVersion** ``Optional[str]`` - APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
        Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
        may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
      * **kind** ``Optional[str]`` - Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
        Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
      * **metadata** ``Optional[meta_v1.ObjectMeta]`` - More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * **overhead** ``Optional[Overhead]`` - overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a
        given RuntimeClass. For more details, see
         https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/
      * **scheduling** ``Optional[Scheduling]`` - scheduling holds the scheduling constraints to ensure that pods running with
        this RuntimeClass are scheduled to nodes that support it. If scheduling is
        nil, this RuntimeClass is assumed to be supported by all nodes.

        RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node
        matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's
        existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in
        admission.
      * **tolerations** ``Optional[List[core_v1.Toleration]]`` - tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this
        RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated
