# 🔮 GENIE: [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS) Lightweight Inference Engine

**A high-performance, lightweight inference engine specifically designed for GPT-SoVITS**

[简体中文](./README_zh.md) | [English](./README.md)

</div>

---

**GENIE** is a lightweight inference engine built on the open-source TTS
project [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS). It integrates TTS inference, ONNX model conversion, API
server, and other core features, aiming to provide ultimate performance and convenience.

* **✅ Supported Model Version:** GPT-SoVITS V2
* **✅ Supported Language:** Japanese

## 🚀 Performance Advantages

GENIE optimizes the original model for outstanding CPU performance.

| Feature                     |  🔮 GENIE   | Official PyTorch Model | Official ONNX Model |
|:----------------------------|:-----------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------:|
| **First Inference Latency** |  **1.13s**  |         1.35s          |        3.57s        |
| **Runtime Size**            | **\~200MB** |      \~several GB      |  Similar to GENIE   |
| **Model Size**              | **\~230MB** |    Similar to GENIE    |       \~750MB       |

> 📝 **Note:** Since GPU inference latency does not significantly improve over CPU for the first packet, we currently
> only provide a CPU version to ensure the best out-of-the-box experience.
>
> 📝 **Latency Test Info:** All latency data is based on a test set of 100 Japanese sentences (\~20 characters each),
> averaged. Tested on CPU i7-12620H.

## 🏁 QuickStart

> **⚠️ Important:** It is recommended to run GENIE in **Administrator mode** to avoid potential performance degradation.

### 📦 Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install genie-tts
```

> 📝 **You may encounter an installation failure when trying to install pyopenjtalk. This is because pyopenjtalk
> is a library that includes C extensions, and the publisher does not currently provide pre-compiled binary packages (
> wheels).
> For Windows users, this requires
installing [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Specifically, you
must select the "Desktop
> development with C++" workload during the installation process.**

### ⚡️ Quick Tryout

No GPT-SoVITS model yet? No problem!
GENIE includes predefined speaker characters for immediate use without any model
files. Run the code below to hear it in action:

```python
import genie_tts as genie
import time

# Automatically downloads required files on first run
genie.load_predefined_character('misono_mika')

genie.tts(
    character_name='misono_mika',
    text='どうしようかな……やっぱりやりたいかも……！',
    play=True,  # Play the generated audio directly
)

time.sleep(10)  # Add delay to ensure audio playback completes
```

### 🎤 TTS Best Practices

A simple TTS inference example:

```python
import genie_tts as genie

# Step 1: Load character voice model
genie.load_character(
    character_name='<CHARACTER_NAME>',  # Replace with your character name
    onnx_model_dir=r"<PATH_TO_CHARACTER_ONNX_MODEL_DIR>",  # Folder containing ONNX model
)

# Step 2: Set reference audio (for emotion and intonation cloning)
genie.set_reference_audio(
    character_name='<CHARACTER_NAME>',  # Must match loaded character name
    audio_path=r"<PATH_TO_REFERENCE_AUDIO>",  # Path to reference audio
    audio_text="<REFERENCE_AUDIO_TEXT>",  # Corresponding text
)

# Step 3: Run TTS inference and generate audio
genie.tts(
    character_name='<CHARACTER_NAME>',  # Must match loaded character
    text="<TEXT_TO_SYNTHESIZE>",  # Text to synthesize
    play=True,  # Play audio directly
    save_path="<OUTPUT_AUDIO_PATH>",  # Output audio file path
)

print("🎉 Audio generation complete!")
```

## 🔧 Model Conversion

To convert original GPT-SoVITS models for GENIE, ensure `torch` is installed:

```bash
pip install torch
```

Use the built-in conversion tool:

> **Tip:** `convert_to_onnx` currently supports only V2 models.

```python
import genie_tts as genie

genie.convert_to_onnx(
    torch_pth_path=r"<YOUR .PTH MODEL FILE>",  # Replace with your .pth file
    torch_ckpt_path=r"<YOUR .CKPT CHECKPOINT FILE>",  # Replace with your .ckpt file
    output_dir=r"<ONNX MODEL OUTPUT DIRECTORY>"  # Directory to save ONNX model
)
```

## 🌐 Launch FastAPI Server

GENIE includes a lightweight FastAPI server:

```python
import genie_tts as genie

# Start server
genie.start_server(
    host="0.0.0.0",  # Host address
    port=8000,  # Port
    workers=1  # Number of workers
)
```

> For request formats and API details, see our [API Server Tutorial](./Tutorial/English/API%20Server%20Tutorial.py).

---

## ⌨️ Launch CMD Client

GENIE provides a simple command-line client for quick testing and interactive use:

```python
import genie_tts as genie

# Launch CLI client
genie.launch_command_line_client()
```

---
