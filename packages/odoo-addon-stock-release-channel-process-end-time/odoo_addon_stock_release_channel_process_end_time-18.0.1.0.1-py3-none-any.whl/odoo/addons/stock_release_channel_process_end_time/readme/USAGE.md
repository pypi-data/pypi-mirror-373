Assign the release channel's process end date to the pickings as
scheduled date:

1.  Assign a timezone on the Warehouse address if defined and if needed
    If you have a lot of warehouses in the same timezone, you can also
    define the timezone on the company partner. If you don't define a
    timezone on the warehouse(s) nor the company, the process end time
    on channels will be considered as UTC.
2.  Propagate/update scheduled date of picking follow process end
    date/time automatically by setting "Update Scheduled Date"
    configuration in Settings/General Settings/Inventory
3.  Go To Release Channels
4.  Set an end time
5.  Wake up the channel
6.  The assigned pickings have their scheduled date set at the next end
    time. (if enabled "Update Scheduled Date" config)

When the assigned pickings are released, the move date deadline is set
to the scheduled date into the pickings generated by the release
process.
