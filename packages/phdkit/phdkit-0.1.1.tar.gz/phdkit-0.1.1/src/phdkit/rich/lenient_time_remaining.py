"""A small `rich` progress column with a lenient time-remaining estimate.

The standard `rich` TimeRemainingColumn sometimes hides the remaining time
when the speed estimate is considered unreliable. This column attempts to be
more helpful by falling back to a simple global-average estimate when the
default estimator returns the placeholder string.

This is suitable for progress bars where showing a rough remaining time is
preferable to showing nothing.
