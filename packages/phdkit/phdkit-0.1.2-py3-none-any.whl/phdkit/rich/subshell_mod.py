"""Small utility to run subprocesses with a live, scrolling Rich Panel.

This module exposes a factory function `subshell` which returns a callable
that runs a subprocess and streams its stdout/stderr lines into a
Rich Panel that scrolls. It's useful for showing command output in a
terminal UI while keeping only the last N lines visible.

Example:
    run = subshell("Build", 10)
    rc = run(["/usr/bin/make"], check=True)
