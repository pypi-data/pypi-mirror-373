## ‚≠êNaming Convention

To keep things clean and intuitive, **Chillax** uses `camelCase` for function names.  
This makes it easy to read and understand at a glance.  

```python
# Example
Chillax.writeAPoem("English")                            
Chillax.translateFrenchToEnglish("Je suis Inde")                  
```
