# Chillax 😎

**Chillax** is a fun and playful Python package where **any function you call automatically gets mapped to an AI call**.  
Instead of implementing logic yourself, Chillax forwards your function calls to **Google Gemini AI**, and returns the response.  

This is made as a fun package, so that whenever you are stuck with implementng the logic, you could just ask AI for the answer in between
