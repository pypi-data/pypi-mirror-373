If your Python application offers CSV export of user-generated data, that user-generated data might contain malicious
payloads that might trigger vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software of the user that downloads the file (i.e. MS
Excel or LibreOffice).

This library tries to mitigate that by prepending all cells starting with ``@``, ``+``,
``-``, ``=``, ``|`` or ``%`` with an apostrophe ``'`` and additionally replacing all
``|`` characters in these cells with ``\|``. This will of course change the resulting
CSV files, but Excel will not display the ``'`` character to the user.

Tested with Python 3.9 to 3.13.

Usage
-----

This library acts as a drop-in replacement for the standard library's ``csv`` module. You can use it by just replacing
``import csv`` with ``from defusedcsv import csv`` in your code.
