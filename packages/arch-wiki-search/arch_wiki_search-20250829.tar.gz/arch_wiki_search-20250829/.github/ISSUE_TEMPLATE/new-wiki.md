I would like this to be added to the list of known wikis:

---
- name: shortnamenospaceallsmall
- url: 'https://top.level.tld' #ex: https://wiki.site.org
- searchstring: '/?parameter1=value1&parameter2=' #the search term will be appended to this; ex: /?search=


DO TEST these values with the -u and -s options, and by adding them to the wikis.yaml file on your machine

Do include the -d flag

Explain why this wiki is useful
