    '''
    Extract phase and amplitude (envelope) from a frequency band or a set of frequency bands all
    at once.
    Each band is computed by averaging over the envelopes and phases computed from the Hilbert Transform
    of each filter output in a filterbank of bandpass filters [#edwards]_. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : naplib.Data instance, optional
        Data object containing data to be filtered in one of the fields. If None, then must give
        the signals to be filtered in the 'field' argument.
    field : string | list of np.ndarrays or a multidimensional np.ndarray
        Field of trials to filter. If a string, it must specify one of the fields of the Data
        provided in the first argument. If a multidimensional array, first dimension
        indicates the trial/instances which will be concatenated over to compute
        normalization statistics. Each trial is filtered independently.
    fs : string | int, default='dataf'
        Sampling rate of the data. Either a string specifying a field of the Data or an int
        giving the sampling rate for all trials.
    Wn : list or array-like, shape (n_freq_bands, 2) or (2,), default=[[70, 150]]
        Lower and upper boundaries for filterbank center frequencies. The default
        of [[70, 150]] extracts the phase and amplitude of the highgamma band.
    bandnames : list of strings, length=n_freq_bands, optional
        If provided, these are used to create the field names for each frequency band's amplitude
        and phase in the output Data. Should be the same length as the number of bands
        specified in Wn. For example, if Wn=[[8,12],[70,150]], and bandnames=['alpha','highgamma'],
        then the fields of the output Data will be {'alpha phase', 'alpha amp', 'highgamma phase',
        'highgamma amp'}. But if bandnames=None, then they will be {'[ 8 12] phase', '[ 8 12] amp',
        '[ 70 150] phase', '[ 70 150] amp'}.
    fs_out : int, default=None
        If not None, each output phase and amplitude will be resampled to this sampling rate.
    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of jobs to use to compute filterbank across channels in parallel in filterbank_hilbert.
        Using n_jobs != 1 is memory intensive, so it will not necessarily improve performance if working
        with a large dataset.

    Returns
    -------
    phase_amplitude_data : naplib.Data instance
        An instance of naplib.Data containing 2*n_freq_bands fields. For each frequency band,
        there will be a field for phase and a field for amplitude of that band, each with
        shape (time, channels) for each trial.
