# AstroLaza Package

This package has been developed by A. Laza-Ramos, PhD student at the Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia.
The contents of this package are realted to his thesis, which includes the physical characterization of high-z galaxies (z>6) using, mostly, JWST NIRSpec IFU data.
In this package you will find functions that allows you to work with SED fitting (based on BAGPIPES, Carnall+1*), working out physical aparameters (especially, mass-related quantities), map-binning and plotting all aforementioned results.
