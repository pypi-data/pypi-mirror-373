# ISOSIMpy

Lumped parameter groundwater age simulations with a simple user interface - in Python.

ISOSIMpy is an open-source framework for the analysis of groundwater residence time distributions with lumped parameter models. ISOSIMpy is not only usable as a Python package but is also released as standalone application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI closes the gap in accessibility between complex Python-based workflows and practical applications outside Python.

## Installing ISOSIMpy

The package can be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ISOSIMpy/). To install the Python package, simply

`pip install ISOSIMpy`

To use the GUI, the Python package does not need to be installed. You can simply download and use the latest version from [the releases on GitHub](https://github.com/iGW-TU-Dresden/ISOSIMpy/releases) (look for the ISOSIMpy-vX.X.X.exe in any release).
