# AudioPlayer
![](res/audioplayer.png)

## A textual.app for playing online radio streams
The app was actually developed for the Raspberry Pi to provide a simple but attractive interface for a Raspi LCD display.
However, the app works in principle on all Linux distributions that meet the following requirements:

* a terminal which supports Rich Python library
* can run a VLC-Player
* uses ALSA soundsystem
