Infercnv is a scalable python library to infer copy number variation (CNV) events from single cell transcriptomics data. It is heavliy inspired by [InferCNV][], but plays nicely with [scanpy][] and is much more scalable.

**WARNING**:

**This package is still experimental. The results have not been validated,
except in that they look similar, but not identical, to the results of InferCNV.**

**We are happy about feedback and welcome contributions!**

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

- [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install infercnvpy:

1. Install the latest release of `infercnvpy` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/infercnvpy/>`\_:

```bash
pip install infercnvpy
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/icbi-lab/infercnvpy.git@main
```

To (optionally) run the `copyKAT` algorithm, you need a working R installation
and the [copykat][] package installed. Usually, if `R` is in your `PATH`, [`rpy2`][rpy2] automatically
detects your R installation. If you get an error message while importing `infercnvpy`,
try setting the `R_HOME` environment variable before importing infercnvpy:

```python
import os

os.environ["R_HOME"] = "/usr/lib/R"
import infercnvpy
```
