# Objective
You are a detail-oriented proofreader. You will be given a noisy, poorly-formatted OCR scan of a screenplay that may contain many typos, extraneous characters, extra or missing line breaks, misspellings, inconsistent capitalization, etc. Your task is to fix all the typos and reformat the text in standard fountain formatting.

# Output Contract
1. Start and end the response with three backticks.
2. Respond only with cleand up, fountain formatted screenplay text. Do not include any introduction or niceties.
3. Do not include XML-like tags or non-fountain formatting.

# Formatting Instructions

## Scene Headings
1. Put scene headings in all caps.
2. Put a blank line before and after each scene heading.
3. Remove any scene numbers before or after the scene heading.  
4. Scene headings start with "INT." for interior scenes and "EXT." for exterior scenes, followed by the scene's setting, and then finally " - DAY" for day scenes and " - NIGHT" for night scenes. (You might see another signifier like "CONTINUOUS", "DAWN", "SUNSET" but these are rare.)
5. Discard any "OMIT" or "CONTINUED" scene headings.

## Action and Description
1. Put a blank line before and after each paragraph of action/description.
2. Preserve paragraphs of description.

## Dialogue
1. Put character names for dialogue in all caps.
2. Put a blank line before a character name for dialogue.
3. Put a blank line after the dialogue block.
4. Never put a blank line after a character name for dialogue. Always follow it with a dialogue block or parenthetical on the very next line.

## Parentheticals
1. There are two types of parentheticals: "character qualifying" and "action/direction".
2. Character qualifying parentheticals are (V.O.), (O.S.), and (CONT'D). These always go in all caps on the same line as the character name.
3. Action/direction parentheticals are anything that modify the dialogue or the character's action while delivering the line. These always go on their own line, with no blank space before or after.
4. Only use "(" and ")" for parentheticals, never {/} or [/].
5. It is possible that a dialogue block may end with a parenthetical. This is rare: avoid it unless you're sure it's what the writer intended. This is the only case when a parenthetical should be followed by a blank line.

## Page Breaks
Remove text that's there to indicate a page break, like:
- (CONTINUED)
- (CONT'D)
- (MORE)

## Transitions
1. Transitions should be in all caps, and sometimes but not always are followed by a colon.
2. Put a blank line before and after each transition.
3. The kinds of transitions you might see are:
- FADE IN:
- CUT TO:
- IRIS TO:
- FADE OUT
- FADE TO BLACK
- FLARE TO WHITE
- FADE IN FROM WHITE:
- THE END
- DISSOLVE TO:

## Additional Formatting
1. Do not add your own markdown, for example to make scene heading slugs bold.
2. When in doubt, the output should be pure text with minimal formatting.
3. Do not add formatting other than what's described here.
4. If there are asterisks to mark changes, remove them.
5. If there are dates to mark changes/drafts, remove them.
6. Remove all page numbers, whether just digits or digits plus letters.

David clutches his baseball glove and several computer
books protectively as he watches his father wheel a
pink baby crib through the door to his room. It is a
l2-year-old's paradise. A slot car track runs under

oma the bunk beds, and a scale model of the Empire State
Building stands in one corner. There is a life-size
poster of Don Mattingly on the door and a green bed-
spread marked off like a football field. He winces
as the crib is wheeled over the tracks.
