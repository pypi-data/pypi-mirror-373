# Objective
You are a detail-oriented proofreader. You will be given a noisy, poorly-formatted OCR scan of some text that may contain many typos, extraneous characters, extra or missing line breaks, missspellings, inconsistent capitalization, etc. Your task is to fix all the typos and return the text as plain text.

# Output Contract
1. Start and end the response with three backticks.
2. Respond only with the cleaned up, corrected text. Do not include any introduction or niceties.
3. Do not include XML-like tags or other formatting.

# Formatting Instructions
1. Stay as true as possible to the input text. Do not invent.
2. Fix obvious mistakes like misspellings, inconsistent capitalization, OCR errors like swapping 1/l or 0/O.
3. Render each paragraph of the original text as a single line of output text.
4. Separate paragraphs of output text with a blank line.
5. When a word is broken/hyphenated to accomodate a line break, remove the hyphen and restore the natural word.
6. When in doubt, preserve the original formatting.
7. Omit page numbers.
8. Omit repetitive text that is not part of the main text, like book titles or chapter headings that might appear at the top of every page.
9. If a paragraph single paragraph is obviously broken by a page break, restore it to be a single continuous paragraph. When in doubt do not combine paragraphs.

In the morning when jhou risest unwillingly,
let this thought be present—I am rising to the
work of a human being. Why then am I dis-
satisfied if I am going to do the things for
which I exist and for which [ was brought into
the world? Or have I been made for this, to
lie in the bedclothes and keep myself warm ?
—But this is more pleasant—Dost thou exist
then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for
action or exertion? Dost thou not see the
little plants, the little birds, the ants, the
spiders, the bees working together to put
jn order their several parts of the universe ?
‘And art thou unwilling to do the work of a
human being, and dost thou not make haste to
do that which is according to thy nature ?—
But it is necessary to take rest also—lt is
necessary : however nature has fixed bounds to
this too; she has fixed bounds both to eating
and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these
bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy
acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of
what thou canst do. So thou lovest not thy-
self, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love thy
nature and her will. But those who love their

several arts exhaust themselves in working at
them unwashed and without food; but thou
valuest thy own nature less than the turner
values the turning art, or the dancer the
dancing art, or the lover of money values his
money, or the vainglorious man his little glory.
And such men, when they have a violent affec-
tion to a thing, choose neither to eat nor to
sleep rather than to perfect the things which
they care for. But are the acts which concern
society more vile in thy eyes and less worthy of
thy labour?

2. H ow easy it is to repel and to wipe away
every impression which is troublesome or
unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tran-
quillity.

3. Judge every word and deed which are
according to nature to be fit for thee ; and be
not diverted by the blame which follows from
any people nor by their words, but if a thing
is good to be done or said, do not consider it
unworthy of thee. For those persons have
their peculiar leading principle and follow their
peculiar movement ; which things do not thou
regard, but go straight on, following thy own
nature and the common nature ; and the way
of both is one.

4. I gothrough the things which happen
according to nature until I shall fall and rest,
breathing out my breath into that element out
of which I daily draw it in, and falling upon
that earth out of which my father collected the
seed,  and my mother the blood, and my nurse
the milk ; out of which during so many years

I have been supplied with food and drink ;
which bears me when I tread on it and abuse
it for so many purposes.

5. Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the
sharpness of thy wits—Be it so : but there are
many other things of which thou canst not say,
I am not formed for them by nature. Show
those qualities then which are altogether in thy
power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour,
aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy
portion and with few things, benevolence,
frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from
trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how
many qualities thou art immediately able to
exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural
incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still
remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art
thou compelled through being defectively fur-
nished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy,
and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor
body, and to try to please men, and to make
great display, and to be so restless in thy mind?
No by the gods : but thou mightest have been
delivered from these things long ago. Only
if in truth thou canst be charged with
being rather slow and dull of comprehension,
thou must exert thyself about this also, not
neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy
dulness.

6. One man, when he has done a service to
another, is ready to set it down to his account
as a favour conferred. Another is not ready to
do this, but still in his own mind he thinks of
the man as his debtor, and he knows what he

has done. A third in a manner does not even
know what he has done, but he is like a vine
which has produced grapes, and seeks for nothing
more after it has once produced its proper fruit.
As a horse when he has run, a dog when he
has tracked the game, a bee when it has made
the honey, so a man when he has done a good
act, does not call out for others to come and
see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine
goes on to produce again the grapes in season
— Must a man then be one of these, who in a
manner act thus without observing it ?—Yes—
But this very thing is necessary, the observation
of what a man is doing : for, it may be said,
it is characteristic of the social animal to per-
ceive that he is working in a social manner,
and indeed to wish that his social partner also
should perceive it—It is true what thou sayest,
but thou dost not rightly understand what is
now said: and for this reason thou wilt be-
come one of those of whom I spoke before, for
even they are misled by a certain show of
reason. But if thou wilt choose to understand
the meaning of what is said, do not fear that
for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.
