Examples: Tabulated Material
============================

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to use the `TabulatedMaterial` class from the PyOptik library.
These examples illustrate the practical applications of working with tabulated refractive index and absorption data, which is useful for analyzing materials based on empirical measurements.

Contents
--------

- **Basic Tabulated Material Usage**: Shows how to create an instance of the `TabulatedMaterial` class and access the refractive index and absorption values.
- **Interpolating Refractive Index**: Demonstrates how to interpolate the refractive index and absorption values for a given range of wavelengths.
- **Visualization Example**: Provides an example of plotting the refractive index and absorption over a range of wavelengths using the `plot` method.
