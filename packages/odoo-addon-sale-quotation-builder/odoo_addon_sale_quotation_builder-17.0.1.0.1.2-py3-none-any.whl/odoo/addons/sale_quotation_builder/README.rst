Use Cases / Context
===================

After this PR (https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/133773), Odoo removed
the ``sale_quotation_builder`` module and added a new one called
``sale_pdf_quote_builder``.

Both features work fine, but there is no direct equivalence between
them. For new customers, it's okay to use the new module to upload PDF
documents. However, customers upgrading from older versions may want to
keep the old behavior.

This module restores those features.

Usage
=====

To generate a template
----------------------

1. Go to ``Sales`` > ``Configuration`` > ``Sales Orders`` >
   ``Quotation Templates``.
2. Create or edit a record.
3. In the form-view header, click the ``Design Template`` button to open
   the website editor.
4. Build your layout by dragging and dropping block snippets, then save.

To generate a new quotation
---------------------------

1. Go to ``Sales`` > ``Orders`` > ``Quotations``.
2. Create or edit a quotation.
3. Select the template created in the previous step.
4. Click the ``Preview`` button. You will be redirected to the portal,
   where you can see the layout.
