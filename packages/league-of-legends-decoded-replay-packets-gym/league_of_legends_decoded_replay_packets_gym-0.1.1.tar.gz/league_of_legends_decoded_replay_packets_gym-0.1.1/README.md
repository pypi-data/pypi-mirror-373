], repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets")
```

### Local Files
```python
# Use your own replay files
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(["local_replay.jsonl.gz"])
```

## 🤖 AI Examples

### Action Prediction with OpenLeague5
```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.examples.openleague5 import OpenLeague5Model

# Load professional data  
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(
    ["12_22/"],  # Download entire patch directory
    repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets"
)
dataset.load(max_games=1)

# Create environment and jump to 15 minutes
env = lol_gym.LeagueReplaysEnv(dataset)
obs, info = env.reset()

# Step to 15 minutes (900 seconds)
while info['current_time'] < 900:
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(0)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break

# AI predicts what players will do next
model = OpenLeague5Model()
game_state = info['game_state']

prediction = model.predict_next_action(game_state, temperature=1.0)
print(f"🔮 AI Prediction: {prediction.get_action_description()}")
print(f"   Confidence: {prediction.confidence:.3f}")
```

### Champion Movement Visualization
```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.examples.champion_gif_generator import ChampionGifGenerator

# Create animated GIF of champion movements
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(
    ["worlds_2022/finals.jsonl.gz"],
    repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets"
)
dataset.load(max_games=1)

generator = ChampionGifGenerator()
generator.create_gif(
    dataset=dataset,
    output_path="worlds_final_movements.gif",
    max_time_minutes=5,
    fps=6
)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Observations
```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.observations import MinimapObservation

# Create 128x128 minimap observation
minimap_obs = MinimapObservation(
    resolution=128, 
    channels=['heroes', 'minions', 'structures']
)

env = lol_gym.LeagueReplaysEnv(dataset, observation_callback=minimap_obs)
obs, info = env.reset()

print(f"Minimap shape: {obs['minimap'].shape}")  # [3, 128, 128]
```

### Raw Parser Access
```python
# Direct access to replay parsing
parser = lol_gym.UnifiedLeagueParser()
result = parser.parse_file("replay.jsonl.gz")

print(f"Parsed {result.games_parsed} games")
print(f"Total events: {result.total_events}")
print(f"Method used: {result.method_used}")
```

### Multi-Environment Training
```python
# Multiple parallel environments for RL training
manager = lol_gym.MultiEnvManager(dataset, num_envs=4)
states = manager.reset()

for epoch in range(100):
    # Step all environments in parallel
    results = manager.step()
    
    for i, (obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info) in enumerate(results):
        if terminated or truncated:
            print(f"Environment {i} finished game")

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Gymnasium Environment
- **Observation Space**: Configurable (positions, minimap, events, custom)
- **Action Space**: Discrete actions (continue, skip, jump to time)
- **Reward Function**: Customizable based on research needs
- **Info Dict**: Rich game state with decoded packet access

### Game State Access
```python
game_state = info['game_state']

# Core information
game_state.current_time          # Game time in seconds
game_state.heroes               # All heroes {net_id: hero_info}
game_state.positions            # All positions {net_id: Position}
game_state.events              # Recent events [GameEvent]

# Convenience methods
game_state.get_heroes_by_team('ORDER')           # Team filtering
game_state.get_heroes_in_radius(pos, 1000)      # Spatial queries  
game_state.get_events_by_type('CastSpellAns')   # Event filtering
```

### Packet Types
The environment provides access to decoded packet data including:
- `CreateHero`: Hero spawn events
- `WaypointGroup`: Movement and positioning
- `CastSpellAns`: Ability usage
- `UnitApplyDamage`: Combat events
- `BuyItem`: Item purchases
- `HeroDie`: Elimination events

## 🎓 Research Applications

- **Esports Analytics**: Analyze professional gameplay patterns
- **AI Development**: Train League of Legends playing agents
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Standard gym environment for RL research  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Study decision-making in competitive gaming
