              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

print(f"⏰ Starting at time: {info['current_time']:.1f}s")

# Step through decoded replay packets
for step in range(100):
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(0)  # Continue action
    
    game_state = info['game_state']
    
    if game_state.heroes:
        print(f"Step {step}: t={game_state.current_time:.1f}s, "
              f"heroes={len(game_state.heroes)}, "
              f"events={len(game_state.events)}")
        
        # Access decoded packet data
        for net_id, hero in list(game_state.heroes.items())[:3]:
            pos = game_state.get_position(net_id)
            if pos:
                print(f"  {hero.get('name', 'Hero')}: ({pos.x:.0f}, {pos.z:.0f})")

# Individual files also supported
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset([
    "12_22/batch_001.jsonl.gz",      # Pro matches, patch 12.22
    "12_22/batch_002.jsonl.gz",      # More pro matches
    "worlds_2022/semifinals.jsonl.gz", # Championship matches
    "worlds_2022/finals.jsonl.gz"      # Grand finals
], repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets")
```

### Local Files
```python
# Use your own replay files
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(["local_replay.jsonl.gz"])
```

## 🤖 AI Examples

### Champion Movement Visualization

![movement](champion_movement.gif)

```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.examples.champion_gif_generator import ChampionGifGenerator

# Create animated GIF of champion movements
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(
    ["worlds_2022/finals.jsonl.gz"],
    repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets"
)
dataset.load(max_games=1)

generator = ChampionGifGenerator()
generator.create_gif(
    dataset=dataset,
    output_path="worlds_final_movements.gif",
    max_time_minutes=5,
    fps=6
)
```

### Action Prediction with OpenLeague5
```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.examples.openleague5 import OpenLeague5Model

# Load professional data  
dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset(
    ["12_22/"],  # Download entire patch directory
    repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets"
)
dataset.load(max_games=1)

# Create environment and jump to 15 minutes
env = lol_gym.LeagueReplaysEnv(dataset)
obs, info = env.reset()

# Step to 15 minutes (900 seconds)
while info['current_time'] < 900:
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(0)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break

# AI predicts what players will do next
model = OpenLeague5Model()
game_state = info['game_state']

prediction = model.predict_next_action(game_state, temperature=1.0)
print(f"🔮 AI Prediction: {prediction.get_action_description()}")
print(f"   Confidence: {prediction.confidence:.3f}")
```

```bash

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Observations
```python
from league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym.observations import MinimapObservation

# Create 128x128 minimap observation
minimap_obs = MinimapObservation(
    resolution=128, 
    channels=['heroes', 'minions', 'structures']
)

env = lol_gym.LeagueReplaysEnv(dataset, observation_callback=minimap_obs)
obs, info = env.reset()

print(f"Minimap shape: {obs['minimap'].shape}")  # [3, 128, 128]
```

### Raw Parser Access
```python
# Direct access to replay parsing
parser = lol_gym.UnifiedLeagueParser()
result = parser.parse_file("replay.jsonl.gz")

print(f"Parsed {result.games_parsed} games")
print(f"Total events: {result.total_events}")
print(f"Method used: {result.method_used}")
```

### Multi-Environment Training
```python
# Multiple parallel environments for RL training
manager = lol_gym.MultiEnvManager(dataset, num_envs=4)
states = manager.reset()

for epoch in range(100):
    # Step all environments in parallel
    results = manager.step()
    
    for i, (obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info) in enumerate(results):
        if terminated or truncated:
            print(f"Environment {i} finished game")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Gymnasium Environment
- **Observation Space**: Configurable (positions, minimap, events, custom)
- **Action Space**: Discrete actions (continue, skip, jump to time)
- **Reward Function**: Customizable based on research needs
- **Info Dict**: Rich game state with decoded packet access

### Game State Access
```python
game_state = info['game_state']

# Core information
game_state.current_time          # Game time in seconds
game_state.heroes               # All heroes {net_id: hero_info}
game_state.positions            # All positions {net_id: Position}
game_state.events              # Recent events [GameEvent]

# Convenience methods
game_state.get_heroes_by_team('ORDER')           # Team filtering
game_state.get_heroes_in_radius(pos, 1000)      # Spatial queries  
game_state.get_events_by_type('CastSpellAns')   # Event filtering
```

### Packet Types
The environment provides access to decoded packet data including:
- `CreateHero`: Hero spawn events
- `WaypointGroup`: Movement and positioning
- `CastSpellAns`: Ability usage
- `UnitApplyDamage`: Combat events
- `BuyItem`: Item purchases
- `HeroDie`: Elimination events
