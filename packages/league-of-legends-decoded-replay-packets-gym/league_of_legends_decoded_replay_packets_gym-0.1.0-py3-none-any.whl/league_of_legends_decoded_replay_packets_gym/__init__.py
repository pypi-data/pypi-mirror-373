League of Legends Decoded Replay Packets Gym

A Gymnasium environment for League of Legends decoded replay packets,
enabling esports research, AI development, and gameplay analysis.

This package provides:
- Gymnasium-compliant environment for RL/ML applications
- Access to professional replay data from HuggingFace datasets  
- High-performance parsing with Rust backend acceleration
- Flexible observation system for custom feature extraction
- AI examples including OpenLeague5 action prediction system
- Visualization tools for champion movement and analysis

Main components:
- LeagueReplaysEnv: Gymnasium environment for decoded replay packets
- ReplayDataset: Dataset management with HuggingFace integration
- GameState: Rich game state representation with decoded packets
- Observation system: Flexible feature extraction framework
- Examples: OpenLeague5 AI system and visualization tools

Example usage:
    >>> import league_of_legends_decoded_replay_packets_gym as lol_gym
    
    # Load professional data from HuggingFace
    >>> dataset = lol_gym.ReplayDataset([
    ...     "12_22/batch_001.jsonl.gz"
    ... ], repo_id="maknee/league-of-legends-decoded-replay-packets")
    >>> dataset.load()
    
    # Create Gymnasium environment
    >>> env = lol_gym.LeagueReplaysEnv(dataset)
    >>> obs, info = env.reset()
