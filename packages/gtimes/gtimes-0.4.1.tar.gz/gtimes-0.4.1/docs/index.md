## Quick Example

```python
from gtimes.gpstime import gpsFromUTC, UTCFromGps
from gtimes.timefunc import TimefromYearf, dTimetoYearf
import datetime

# Convert UTC to GPS time
gps_week, sow, gps_day, sod = gpsFromUTC(2024, 1, 15, 12, 30, 45.123)
print(f"GPS Week: {gps_week}, SOW: {sow}")
# Output: GPS Week: 2297, SOW: 216645.123

# Convert GPS time back to UTC
utc_dt = UTCFromGps(gps_week, sow, dtimeObj=True)
print(f"UTC: {utc_dt}")
# Output: UTC: 2024-01-15 12:30:45.123000

# Work with fractional years (GAMIT compatible)
dt = datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 1, 12, 0, 0)
yearf = dTimetoYearf(dt)
print(f"Fractional year: {yearf:.6f}")
# Output: Fractional year: 2024.497260

# Convert fractional year back to datetime
dt_back = TimefromYearf(yearf)
print(f"Date: {dt_back}")
# Output: Date: 2024-07-01 11:56:02.976000
```

## Command Line Tools

GTimes includes a powerful command-line interface for time calculations:

```bash
# Get current GPS week and day
timecalc -wd

# Convert specific date to GPS time
timecalc -wd -d "2024-01-15"

# Get fractional year
timecalc -yf -d "2024-07-01"

# Generate RINEX filename patterns
timecalc -l "REYK%j0.%yO" "1D" -d "2024-01-01"
```
