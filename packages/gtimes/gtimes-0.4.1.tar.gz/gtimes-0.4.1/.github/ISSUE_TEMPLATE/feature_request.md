## Feature Summary
A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see added to GTimes.

## Problem/Use Case
What problem does this feature solve? What GPS/GNSS workflow would benefit from this?

**Is your feature request related to a problem?** 
A clear description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

## Proposed Solution
Describe the solution you'd like to see implemented.

### API Design (if applicable)
If you have ideas about how the API should look:

```python
# Example of how you envision using this feature
from gtimes.new_module import new_function

result = new_function(parameter1, parameter2)
```

### Command-Line Interface (if applicable)
If this should be available through `timecalc`:

```bash
# Example command-line usage
timecalc --new-option value -d "2024-01-15"
```
