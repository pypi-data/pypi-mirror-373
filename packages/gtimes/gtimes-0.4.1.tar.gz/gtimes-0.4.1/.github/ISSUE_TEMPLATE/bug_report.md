2. With these parameters: `...`
3. Expected result: `...`
4. Actual result: `...`

## Code Example
```python
# Minimal code example that reproduces the issue
from gtimes.gpstime import gpsFromUTC

# Your code here
result = gpsFromUTC(2024, 1, 15, 12, 30, 45)
print(result)
```

## Expected Behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Actual Behavior
What actually happened, including any error messages.

```
# If applicable, paste the full error traceback here
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ...
```

## Environment Information
Please complete the following information:
- **GTimes version**: [e.g., 0.4.0]
- **Python version**: [e.g., 3.11.5]
- **Operating system**: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 11, macOS 14]
- **Installation method**: [e.g., pip, conda, development install]

```bash
# Run this command and paste the output:
