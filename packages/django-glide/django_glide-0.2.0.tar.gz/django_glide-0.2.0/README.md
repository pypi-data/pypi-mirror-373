# django-glide

This is a Django library to add support to Glide JS in your templates

It supports:

 * Django 3
 * Django 4
 * Django 5

## Installation

```sh
pip install django-glide
```

## Setup

First, add "django_glide" to your list of `INSTALLED_APPS`.


Then either in your base template (to load on all pages) or just in the template you need, add:

```html
{% load glide_tags %}
{% glide_assets %}
```

Then to actually use a glide based carousel, use this in your template:

```html
{% load glide_tags %}

...

{% glide_carousel my_images carousel_id="hero" type="carousel" perView=3 autoplay=3000 %}
```

All the options listed on the example above can be found here: https://glidejs.com/docs/options/

And then in your view, return an object in the context following this format:

```python
my_images = [
    {"image": "/static/img/slide1.jpg", "alt": "Slide 1"},
    {"image": "/static/img/slide2.jpg", "alt": "Slide 2"},
    {"image": "/static/img/slide3.jpg", "alt": "Slide 3"},
]
```

## Using custom template

By default, the template shipped with the library is basic, it can either load an image or some text.
If you wish to use your own template, create a separate file to hold your whole slide and then call it like so:

```html
{% glide_carousel my_custom_data carousel_id="hero" template_name="myapp/custom_slide.html" type="carousel" perView=3 autoplay=3000 %}
```

## Changing the way GlideJS is loaded

By default, this library uses lastest Glide of the jsdelivr CDN, if you want to change this, you can modify one (or all) of the following settings:

```python
GLIDE_JS_URL = "my new URL to fetch the JS"
GLIDE_CSS_CORE_URL = "my new URL to fetch the core CSS"
GLIDE_CSS_THEME_URL = "my new URL to fetch the theme CSS, if you set as None, it won't be loaded"
```
