Networka is a modern CLI tool for automating network devices across multiple vendors. Designed for network engineers who want fast, scalable automation with full cross-platform support.

Built entirely with Sonett 4 and GPT-5, this is an agent-mode experiment that turned into something genuinely useful.

## _The Networka Monologue_

_“People ask the question…_ <br>
**what’s a Networka?** <br>

And I tell 'em — <br>
it's **not** about cables, configs, and pings. <br>
_Oh no._ <br>
There’s more to it than that, my friend. <br>

We all like a bit of the good life — <br>
some the uptime, some the security, <br>
others the automation, the visibility, or the compliance. <br>

But a **Networka**, oh, they're different. <br>
Why? <br>
Because a real **Networka** wants the f\*ing lot.”<br><br>
(inspired by: [RockNRolla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4YLBqMJYOo))

## Installation

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Python**: 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
- **Network Access**: SSH connectivity to target devices
- **Package Manager**: uv (recommended) or pip

### Quick Install (recommended)

Not on PyPI yet — install from GitHub.

```bash
# Recommended (isolated, user-wide)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git

# Alternative
pipx install git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git

# Verify installation
nw --help
```

#### If `nw` is not found

- Check: `command -v nw` (Linux/macOS) or `where nw` (Windows)
- If using pipx: ensure PATH is set, then reload shell
  ```bash
  pipx ensurepath
  exec $SHELL
  ```
- Linux/macOS: add user bin to PATH if needed
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
  exec $SHELL
  ```
- Windows (native, best-effort): prefer WSL2; if native, run `pipx ensurepath` and restart the terminal

### Upgrade & Remove

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version (from GitHub)
uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git
# or
pipx install --force git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git

# Remove installation
uv tool uninstall nw
# or
pipx uninstall networka
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Linux/macOS**: No additional dependencies required

**Windows**: Scrapli (the default transport) does not officially support native Windows. While it may work with Paramiko or ssh2-python drivers, the recommended approach is to run Networka on WSL2 (Ubuntu) for a fully supported POSIX environment. Native Windows usage is best-effort.

WSL2 quickstart (recommended):

```bash
# In Ubuntu on WSL2
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
exec $SHELL
uv tool install git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git
nw --help
```

Details → https://narrowin.github.io/networka/platform-compatibility/#wsl2-quickstart-recommended

## Quick Start

Get up and running with config init command:

```bash
# Initialize in default location with interactive prompts
nw config init

```

### One-liners (no config)

Run directly against an IP without creating files. `--platform` selects the network OS driver; `--interactive-auth` prompts for credentials.

```bash
# MikroTik RouterOS
nw run --platform mikrotik_routeros 192.0.2.10 "/system/identity/print" --interactive-auth
```

```bash
# Cisco IOS-XE
nw run --platform cisco_iosxe 198.51.100.20 "show version" --interactive-auth
```

## Terminology: device_type vs hardware platform vs transport

- device_type: Network OS driver used for connections and commands (Scrapli "platform"). Examples: mikrotik_routeros, cisco_iosxe, arista_eos, juniper_junos.
- platform (hardware/firmware): Hardware architecture used for firmware-related operations (x86, x86_64, arm, mipsbe, tile).
- transport: Connection backend. Default is scrapli.

Note: When targeting IPs directly, `--platform` refers to the network driver (device_type), not hardware architecture.
