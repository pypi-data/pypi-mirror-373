# Changelog

## v0.8.11
- refactor(visual_media_description): remove example lists from field definitions

The example lists in field definitions were redundant as they were already covered in the description text. This change simplifies the model by removing duplicate information.

## v0.8.10

- refactor(whatsapp/models): replace dict types with specific message types

Use proper typed message classes instead of simplified dict structures to improve type safety and maintainability

## v0.8.9

- feat(agent): add method to update static knowledge
