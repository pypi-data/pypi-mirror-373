## Simplicial Attention

Implementation of [2-simplicial attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00668) proposed by Clift et al. (2019) and the recent attempt to make practical in [Fast and Simplex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02754), Roy et al. (2025)

## Appreciation

- [Tejas](https://github.com/meltq) for finding my error in the Triton backwards kernel!

## Install

```shell
$ pip install simplicial-attention
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from simplicial_attention.triton_two_simplicial_attention import SlidingWindowTwoSimplicialMHA

higher_order_attn = SlidingWindowTwoSimplicialMHA(
    dim = 512,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
).cuda()

tokens = torch.randn(2, 1024, 512).cuda()

assert higher_order_attn(tokens).shape == tokens.shape
```

## Example

Enwik8, every 2 layers

```shell
$ pip install '.[examples]' && python train.py
```

## Contributing

First install with `pytest`

```shell
$ pip install '.[test]'
```

Then add your code and make sure it passes

```shell
$ pytest tests
```
