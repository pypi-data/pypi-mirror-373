## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 📥 1. Clone the Source Code & Configure Services

#### 📦 1.1 Clone the Source Code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Pixelle-MCP.git
cd Pixelle-MCP
```

#### ⚙️ 1.2 Configure Services

The project uses a unified YAML configuration scheme:

```shell
# Copy the configuration example file
cp config.yml.example config.yml
# Edit configuration items as needed
```

**📋 Detailed Configuration Instructions:**

The configuration file contains three main sections: Basic Service, MCP Server, and MCP Client. Each section has detailed configuration item descriptions in [`config.yml.example`](config.yml.example).

**🔍 Configuration Checklist:**
- ✅ Copied `config.yml.example` to `config.yml`
- ✅ Configured ComfyUI service address (ensure ComfyUI is running)
- ✅ Configured at least one LLM model (OpenAI or Ollama)
- ✅ Port numbers are not occupied by other services (9001, 9002, 9003)

### 🔧 2. Add MCP Tool (Optional)

This step is optional and only affects your Agent's capabilities. You can skip it if not needed for now.

The `mcp-server/workflows` directory contains a set of popular workflows by default. Run the following command to copy them to your mcp-server. When the service starts, they will be automatically converted into MCP Tools for LLM use.

**Note: It is strongly recommended to test the workflow in your ComfyUI canvas before copying, to ensure smooth execution later.**

```shell
cp -r pixelle/workflows/* pixelle/data/custom_workflows/
```

### 🚀 3. Start the Services

#### 🎯 3.1 Start with Docker (Recommended)

```shell
# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

#### 🛠️ 3.2 One-click Script Start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) environment.

**Linux/macOS users:**
```shell
# Start all services (foreground)
./run.sh

# Or

# Start all services (background)
./run.sh start --daemon
```

**Windows users:**

Simply double-click the `run.bat` script in the root directory

#### 🛠️ 3.3 Manual Service Start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) environment.

**Start Basic Service (mcp-base):**
```shell
cd mcp-base
# Install dependencies (only needed on first run or after updates)
uv sync
# Start service
uv run upload_api.py
```

**Start Server (mcp-server):**
```shell
cd pixelle
# Install dependencies (only needed on first run or after updates)
uv sync
# Start service
uv run upload_api.py
```

**Start Client (mcp-client):**
```shell
cd mcp-client
# Install dependencies (only needed on first run or after updates)
uv sync
# Start service (for hot-reload in dev mode: uv run chainlit run upload_api.py -w --port 9003)
uv run upload_api.py
```


### 🌐 4. Access the Services

After startup, the service addresses are as follows:

- **Client**: 🌐 http://localhost:9003 (Chainlit Web UI, default username and password are both `dev`, can be changed in [`auth.py`](pixelle/web/auth/auth.py))
- **Server**: 🗄️ http://localhost:9002/sse (MCP Server)
- **Base Service**: 🔧 http://localhost:9001/docs (File storage and basic API)

## 🛠️ Add Your Own MCP Tool

⚡ One workflow = One MCP Tool

![](docs/workflow_to_mcp_tool.png)

### 🎯 1. Add the Simplest MCP Tool

* 📝 Build a workflow in ComfyUI for image Gaussian blur ([Get it here](docs/i_blur_ui.json)), then set the `LoadImage` node's title to `$image.image!` as shown below:
![](docs/easy-workflow.png)

* 📤 Export it as an API format file and rename it to `i_blur.json`. You can export it yourself or use our pre-exported version ([Get it here](docs/i_blur.json))

* 📋 Copy the exported API workflow file (must be API format), input it on the web page, and let the LLM add this Tool

  ![](docs/ready_to_send_en.png)

* ✨ After sending, the LLM will automatically convert this workflow into an MCP Tool

  ![](docs/added_mcp_en.png)

* 🎨 Now, refresh the page and send any image to perform Gaussian blur processing via LLM

  ![](docs/use_mcp_tool_en.png)

### 🔌 2. Add a Complex MCP Tool

The steps are the same as above, only the workflow part differs (Download workflow: [UI format](docs/t2i_by_flux_turbo_ui.json) and [API format](docs/t2i_by_flux_turbo.json))

## 🔧 ComfyUI Workflow Custom Specification

### 🎨 Workflow Format
The system supports ComfyUI workflows. Just design your workflow in the canvas and export it as API format. Use special syntax in node titles to define parameters and outputs.

### 📝 Parameter Definition Specification

In the ComfyUI canvas, double-click the node title to edit, and use the following DSL syntax to define parameters:

```
$<param_name>.[~]<field_name>[!][:<description>]
```

#### 🔍 Syntax Explanation:
- `param_name`: The parameter name for the generated MCP tool function
- `~`: Optional, indicates URL parameter upload processing, returns relative path
- `field_name`: The corresponding input field in the node
- `!`: Indicates this parameter is required
- `description`: Description of the parameter

#### 💡 Example:

**Required parameter example:**

- Set LoadImage node title to: `$image.image!:Input image URL`
- Meaning: Creates a required parameter named `image`, mapped to the node's `image` field

**URL upload processing example:**

- Set any node title to: `$image.~image!:Input image URL`
- Meaning: Creates a required parameter named `image`, system will automatically download URL and upload to ComfyUI, returns relative path

> 📝 Note: `LoadImage`, `VHS_LoadAudioUpload`, `VHS_LoadVideo` and other nodes have built-in functionality, no need to add `~` marker

**Optional parameter example:**

- Set EmptyLatentImage node title to: `$width.width:Image width, default 512`
- Meaning: Creates an optional parameter named `width`, mapped to the node's `width` field, default value is 512

### 🎯 Type Inference Rules

The system automatically infers parameter types based on the current value of the node field:
- 🔢 `int`: Integer values (e.g. 512, 1024)
- 📊 `float`: Floating-point values (e.g. 1.5, 3.14)
- ✅ `bool`: Boolean values (e.g. true, false)
- 📝 `str`: String values (default type)

### 📤 Output Definition Specification

#### 🤖 Method 1: Auto-detect Output Nodes
The system will automatically detect the following common output nodes:
- 🖼️ `SaveImage` - Image save node
- 🎬 `SaveVideo` - Video save node
- 🔊 `SaveAudio` - Audio save node
- 📹 `VHS_SaveVideo` - VHS video save node
- 🎵 `VHS_SaveAudio` - VHS audio save node

#### 🎯 Method 2: Manual Output Marking
> Usually used for multiple outputs
Use `$output.var_name` in any node title to mark output:
- Set node title to: `$output.result`
- The system will use this node's output as the tool's return value


### 📄 Tool Description Configuration (Optional)

You can add a node titled `MCP` in the workflow to provide a tool description:

1. Add a `String (Multiline)` or similar text node (must have a single string property, and the node field should be one of: value, text, string)
2. Set the node title to: `MCP`
3. Enter a detailed tool description in the value field


### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **🔒 Parameter Validation**: Optional parameters (without !) must have default values set in the node
2. **🔗 Node Connections**: Fields already connected to other nodes will not be parsed as parameters
3. **🏷️ Tool Naming**: Exported file name will be used as the tool name, use meaningful English names
4. **📋 Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed parameter descriptions for better user experience
5. **🎯 Export Format**: Must export as API format, do not export as UI format
