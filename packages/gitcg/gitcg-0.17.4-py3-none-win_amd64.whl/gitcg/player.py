class Player(ABC):
    """
    An abstract class (interface) of a player of GI-TCG Game.

    A player can receive `notification` by `gitcg.Player.on_notify`. The notification includes:
    - Game state information that is visible to this player, and
    - All mutation information since last notification.

    The `gitcg.Notification` class is generated from Protocol Buffer, its detailed structure is listed [here](https://github.com/guyutongxue/genius-invokation/blob/main/proto/notification.proto).

    A player can handle 5 types of "requests", which are:
    - `action`, when a player action is requested.
    - `chooseActive`, when a player is requested to choose an active character. This usually happens on the initialize phase or the previous active character was defeated.
    - `rerollDice`, when a player is requested to reroll dice. This usually happens on the roll phase.
    - `selectCard`, when a player is requested to select a card. This is the effects of some cards / skills like Chiori.
    - `switchHands`, when a player is requested to switch some cards from/to his hands and pile. This happens on the initialize phase.

    All above requests and responses class are generated from Protocol Buffer, their detailed structure can be found [here](https://github.com/guyutongxue/genius-invokation/blob/main/proto/rpc.proto).

        Implement the logic of how to `switchHands`. The returned `SwitchHandsResponse` must be presented with a list of `removed_hand_ids` that you want to remove from your hands. You will receive same amount of cards from your pile later.

        For example, do not switch any card:
        ```py
        def on_switch_hands(self, request: SwitchHandsRequest) -> SwitchHandsResponse:

        """
        Implement the logic of how to `action`. The `ActionRequest` contains a list of actions you can perform. The returned `ActionResponse` must be presented with an index of the action you want to perform, and some `used_dice` values as this action's cost requirement.

        There are 5 kind of actions, called `use_skill`, `play_card`, `elemenental_tuning`, `switch_active` and `declare_end`. While enumerating `action` on `ActionRequest`, check `action.HasField("use_skill")` to determine which kind of this action is. Then `action.use_skill` will contains detailed information of this action. The detailed data structure of `ActionRequest` can be found [here](https://github.com/guyutongxue/genius-invokation/blob/main/proto/action.proto).

        For example, choose the `declare_end` action:
        ```py
        def on_action(self, request: ActionRequest) -> ActionResponse:
            chosen_index = 0
            for i, action in enumerate(request.action):
                if action.HasField("declare_end"):
                    chosen_index = i
                    break
            # Because no dice required for declare_end, so just omitting `used_dice=[]` argument.
            return ActionResponse(chosen_action_index=chosen_index)
        ```

        Here is a little bit complex example: omni-only-random-action player. This player will only consume OMNI dice to perform a random action. For better test result, set `low_level.ATTR_PLAYER_ALWAYS_OMNI_0`(`1`) in `gitcg.game.set_attr` to make this player always receive OMNI dice on initial roll.
        ```py
        class RandomActionPlayer(Player):
            who: int
            omni_dice_count = 0 # record dice count of OMNI

                self.omni_dice_count = len([i for i in notification.state.player[self.who].dice if i == DiceType.DICE_OMNI])
