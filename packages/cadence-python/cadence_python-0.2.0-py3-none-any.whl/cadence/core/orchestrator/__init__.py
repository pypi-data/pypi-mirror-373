"""Cadence Framework Multi-Agent Orchestrator - LangGraph-Based Conversation Coordination.

This module implements the core multi-agent orchestration system for the Cadence AI framework,
providing intelligent conversation routing, plugin coordination, and state management
through LangGraph workflows.

Orchestration Architecture:
    The orchestrator implements a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system:
    - LangGraph Workflows: State-machine-based conversation flows
    - Dynamic Agent Routing: Intelligent selection of appropriate agents
    - Plugin Integration: Seamless coordination with SDK-based plugins
    - State Management: Persistent conversation context across agent switches
    - Safety Systems: Infinite loop prevention and resource limit enforcement

Core Components:
    MultiAgentOrchestrator: Main orchestration engine with LangGraph integration
    AgentState: Comprehensive state schema for multi-agent conversations
    State Utilities: Helper functions for state manipulation and analysis

Key Features:
    - Plugin-based agent discovery and registration
    - Intelligent routing based on conversation content and context
    - Tool execution coordination with safety limits
    - Conversation history management with optimized storage
    - Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

The orchestrator enables Cadence to coordinate multiple specialized agents seamlessly,
providing users with intelligent, context-aware conversations that can span
multiple domains and capabilities.
