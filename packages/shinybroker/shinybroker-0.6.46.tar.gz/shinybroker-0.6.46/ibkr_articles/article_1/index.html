    <h3>ShinyBroker lets you build the trading system you want in Shiny and
        connect it with Interactive Brokers.</h3>
</section>

<section>
    <p>
        This 'hello world' walkthrough shows you how to set up a good
        development environment, install the <strong>ShinyBroker
    </strong> package, connect it to a running instance of
        TraderWorkstation (TWS) or IB Gateway (IBG), explore a few of
        the default market data features, and use
        <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a> to create a functioning user
        interface. The next article in this series will explain how
        to fetch, process, and graphically display market data from IBKR.

    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The ShinyBroker package, and the examples in the
            documentation, were created with
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">
                PyCharm</a>.
            You certainly <strong>do not</strong> have to use PyCharm,
            but it is used in this article series to make the material
            accessible to readers who aren't old hands at dealing with
            environments, versions, and packages. If you follow this
            tutorial and use PyCharm, you will not have to worry about any of
            that; if you don't, then it's assumed you know what you're
            doing and are comfortable with your own setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Use TWS unless you're already comfortable with IBG.
            </strong>
            ShinyBroker will work fine with IB Gateway, but it's
            recommended to start out with TraderWorkstation so that you
            can use its UI and menus to verify/follow along with
            whatever you're building in ShinyBroker.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Install the following</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Trader Workstation (TWS)</strong>
                You probably already have TWS installed if you're reading
                this article but if not, install it from IBKR's website. You may
                use the Demo account if you don't own an account at IBKR.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Python</strong>: You'll need Python, of course.
                Install the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">
                latest stable version</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>PyCharm</strong>: Download & install from
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">
                    JetBrains</a>. The free community version is fine but if you
                are associated with a university, you might be interested in
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/">
                    JetBrain's Student Pack
                </a> which gives you free access to PyCharm Pro and a lot of
                other interesting tools.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Create a new PyCharm Project</strong>:
            We're going to set up a PyCharm project for this tutorial and
            instruct it to use one and only one dedicated installation of
            Python. This way, you don't have to deal with all sorts of
            compatability problems that may otherwise arise between different
            Python versions, libraries, and so on.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open up PyCharm</strong> and create a new
                project. The "project" is simply a folder that stores
                all files related to this tutorial. You can name it
                whatever you want and store it in a convenient place on
                your computer. Give it a good, informative name that
                you like -- it's helpful.</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Configure an Interpreter</strong>. You want to
                    tell PyCharm to create a dedicated installation of Python
                    only for use by this project, and you can do that by
                    <em>configuring an interpreter</em>.
                    You might have already created an environment for this
                    project when you created a new project; if you did, then
                    you'll see a folder named ".venv" in your project
                    directory, like in the screenshot below:
                </p>
                <img src="venv_success.jpg" alt="venv success">
                <p>
                    If your PyCharm project does <em>not</em> have an
                    interpreter configured, then you will probably be
                    prompted to create one via a clickable banner within
                    PyCharm. If you can't find the banner or if you closed it,
                    you can use the <strong>interpreter settings</strong> menu
                    found under File > Settings. From the interpreter settings
                    window, <strong>add a new local interpreter</strong> in
                    your project folder. You should now see the ".venv"
                    folder in your project directory like the one in the
                    screenshot above. <strong>.venv</strong> contains the
                    installation of Python that your project will use.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Verify that your project is using the correct
                    interpreter</strong>. You can do that quickly by
                glancing at or mousing over the path that appears at the bottom
                right-hand corner of the PyCharm window -- it should display
                the path to the .venv folder in your project directory.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>Word of Advice</strong>: If you've followed these
            steps and are having trouble -- <em>especially</em> if you've
            just installed everything and set up your project all in one
            go -- then you might want to reboot your computer, or at
            least try exiting and restarting PyCharm.

        Once your development environment is set up, either by completing
        <strong>Step 0</strong> or your own project setup, you may proceed.

        Now that ShinyBroker is installed, it's time to make sure your TWS is
        set up to accept data connections from APIs.

        <span class="indicator"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            You need to check a few settings in TWS to make sure it will
            permit a data connection with ShinyBroker.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Launch TWS and sign in to your paper account (or use the demo)
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the API Configuration menu found at File > Global
                Configuration > API > Settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check <strong>Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Un-check <strong>Read-only API</strong> to allow ShinyBroker to
                send orders to TWS. We won't be using this in the current
                tutorial but subsequent articles will need it. Your settings menu
                should now look like the below:
                <div>
                    <img src="api_config.jpg" alt="api config">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Click "Apply" and "OK"</li>
            <li><strong>Don't close TWS</strong>. You'll need it open and
                running or else ShinyBroker won't have an IBKR connection to
                connect to!</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <p>
        Next we'll run a bare-bones ShinyBroker app to check that it
        runs and can connect with TWS. Reminder that <strong>TWS needs
        to be running</strong> in order for ShinyBroker to work, so if you
        shut it down after the previous step, you'll need to launch it again
        before going on to the next.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Run your Python script</strong>. There are many ways
                to do so, but one quick and easy way is to highlight all of the
                code in your script with "select all", right-click the
                selection, and choose "Execute Selection in Python Console".
                It's even faster with keyboard shortcuts, e.g., for a Mac:
                command-A to select all, then alt-shift-E to execute. You can
                find those commands, and their shortcuts, by right-clicking
                on highlighted code in PyCharm.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you execute the code PyCharm will launch a new Python
                console to run the code you told it to run. Your screen
                should look something like the below. You can see what the
                code you ran did: it created a ShinyBroker app object and told
                it where to find an IBKR connection by specifying
                <code>host</code>, <code>port</code>, and
                <code>client_id</code>. By itself, that <code>app</code>
                object does nothing but sit there in variable space; to make
                it run, you have to call its <code>run</code> method, which
                we did in the final line of the sample code when we called
                <code>app.run()</code>. That command is the one that started the
                continuously-running Python process that you see in your
                Console. That process serves your ShinyBroker app at the blue
                hyperlink appearing in the command line output. The app will
                continue to run until you tell it to stop (e.g., by clicking
                the red square in the Python Console in PyCharm).
                <div>
                    <img src="code_execution_success.jpg"
                         alt="code execution success">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                To view your app, <strong>click the hyperlink in the command
                line output</strong>. Doing so will open your first
                ShinyBroker App in your default browser! You can also
                copy-paste the url into a browser of your choice. (And if
                you're thinking <em>can I serve the app on one computer and
                access the app via browser from another computer/phone in a
                different location</em> the answer is "yes, you can", but
                that's a later topic)

            <strong>Especially important to note</strong> is the section on
            the home page, which currently reads <code>
            no ui passed to sb_ui()</code>. That space is special -- it is
            reserved for you, the trader, to put UI elements and controls for
            your trading system. Since no ui was specified when we created
            this simple app object in this hello world example, ShinyBroker
            is telling you that it's empty.

        <p>
            We'll conclude this tutorial in the next step by injecting a little

        If you're new to Shiny and reactive programming it is very highly
        recommended that you brush up on the basics by reviewing some of
        the very accessible and informative videos that the team at Posit has
        created to teach this topic. The video tutorial below, by <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winstonchang1/">Winston Chang</a>
        of <a href="https://posit.co/">Posit</a>, is an excellent place to
        start. As you watch, remember that <em>anything you can build in
        Shiny, you can use in ShinyBroker</em>.

        Now it's time for the real learning & takeaway part of this
        turtorial. Let's take a minute to understand and appreciate that all
        user interfaces must necessarily operate on the same basic principle:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Some kind of new information becomes available as
            <strong>input</strong>; for example: user keystrokes, the market
            price of an asset changes, an order fills, etc. No matter what
            its form or purpose, the point is that some kind of <em>change
        </em> has taken place meaning that there is <em>new</em>, or,
            equivalently, <em>updated</em> data available that is of
            importance to you, the trader. Information like this shows up
            <em>asynchronously</em>, meaning that there is no way to tell
            when or if it will become available. Therefore a system like
            ShinyBroker must always be on the ball and ready to handle
            incoming data as it comes in from the brokerage connection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Incoming data is collected by a server function, whose job it is
            to <strong>process</strong> the data into a useful return value
            and pass that value to the appropriate place in your app. For
            example, the input data might be a time-indexed list containing the
            past hour's prices for a stock at 1-minute intervals, and a server
            function's job might be to accept that list as input and return the
            timestamp of the highest (or lowest, etc.) price during the period.
        </li>
        <li>
            The server function may pass its return value to just about
            anything the trader can dream up but its ultimate fate is
            to be displayed to the trader as some sort of <strong>
            output</strong> that is understandable to the trader; for
            example: a plot, an updated forecast calculation, or a text box.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This tutorial culminates in the next step, which will show you how to
        implement this process using the magic of Shiny, which was written to
        <em>greatly</em> simplify the entire <strong>input</strong> ->
        <strong>processing</strong> -> <strong>output</strong> loop, making
        these kinds of systems much easier for the trader to build.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our newly added ui will cause the ShinyBroker app to operate as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>The user inputs a string to an input text box</li>
        <li>
            A server function watches the contents of the text box and when it
            changes, it appends the string "<strong>You entered '</strong>" to the
            beginning of the input's text, and appends "<strong>'.</strong>"
            to the end; therefore, the resulting string is "<strong>You
            entered '{string that you entered}'.</strong>".
        </li>
        <li>
            The return string is passed to an output text box where you, the
            trader, can read it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        To accomplish this feat we'll need to add 3 new elements to our
        ShinyBroker app:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A <strong>text input box</strong> so that the user has
            something to type into</li>
        <li>
            A <strong>server function</strong> that performs the string
            appending steps
        </li>
        <li>
            A <strong>text output</strong> that displays the final string
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong><u>You can build just about anything you want starting from
            this humble example</u></strong> simply by keeping the "input ->
        processing -> output" data flow in your mind and making intellegent
        use of the buttons, widgets, plots, and other Python tools that are
        readily available in Shiny and other Python packages.

            <span class="dropdown-text">
                Add some UI to the app
            </span>
        </span>
        <span class="indicator"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            First, we'll need the two pieces of UI that will appear on the
            web page: an input for the user to type into, and an output to
            see the result. We'll use the <code>input_text</code> and
            <code>output_code</code> objects made available by the
            <code>ui</code> object in Shiny, and store them together in a
            <code>div</code>, with the input on top of the output. <a
                href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/components/">All sorts of
            different components are available</a> both in Shiny and in
            other packages like <a
                href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/jupyter-widgets.html">
            shinywidgets</a>, or you can <a
                href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/custom-components-pkg.html">
            build your own</a>. In this example, however, we'll only need two
            components: <code>input_text</code> and <code>output_code</code>.
            In the code below we use these components to create a new piece of
            ui and assign to it the appropriate name <code>
            a_piece_of_new_ui</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
from shiny import ui

# Some UI to add to the app
a_piece_of_new_ui = ui.div(
    ui.input_text(
        id='sb_example_text_in',
        label='Example Input. Type something!'
    ),
    ui.output_code('sb_example_text_out')
)
</code></pre>
        <p>Now we need some logic: a function that recognizes the input text
            box (which we named <code>sb_example_text_in</code> above) as an
            input that it needs to watch. It should also possess the
            additional properties such that, whenever the text in the input
            changes, the function executes, calculates the new string that we
            want for the text output, and sends that value to the output
            object that we named <code>sb_example_text_out</code>.
            ShinyBroker uses the Shiny framework (see the video above) to
            simplify all of the 'watching and updating' tasks in order to
            make it easy to write a function that does the job.</p>
        <p>In Shiny-speak, what we want to write is called a <strong>rendering
            function</strong>, a special type of function that was created
            for exactly the kind of 'watching and updating' functionality
            that we need. A suitable rendering function is provided below but
            if you're new to Shiny, consider the following bullet points
            to help you understand rendering functions and why the code is
            written the way it is so that you can be better equipped to write
            your own.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shiny takes into consideration the names you give to your
                server functions and uses them to figure out where the
                return values should be passed. In most use cases, including
                the current tutorial, that's a lot simpler than it sounds
                because it boils down to: <em>when you write your function,
                <strong>just give it the same name as the output
                    you want it to update</strong></em>. That simple 'rule'
                will get you through 95% of your use cases. In our case, we
                want to update the output object named <code>
                    sb_example_text_out</code>, so that's the name we'll assign
                to our function.</li>
            <li>We want the function to run every time the value of the input
                box <code>sb_example_text_in</code> changes, so somewhere
                within the function's body we'll need to call
                <code>input.sb_example_text_in()</code> to fetch the contents
                of the input box. Shiny handles the rest, which is extremely
                convenient because it allows you to treat <code>input
                    .sb_example_text_in()</code> almost like a variable that
                you can always trust to contain "whatever is currently in the
                input box". Note that calling an input function to get its
                value carries with it a computational expense, so if you find
                yourself making calls to the same input more than once within
                the same render function, it's probably bad code. You're most
                likely better off if you just make the call <em>once</em>,
                store the input's value as a local variable, and then use
                that variable in the rest of your function code.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, we want to communicate to Shiny that our function is
                indeed a <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/build-an-app/reactive-flow/render-functions.html">
                    rendering function</a>, which we can do by decorating it
                with a <code>@render</code> decorator. All sorts of render
                decorators are available, and of course you can <a
                        href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/core/Renderer.html"
                >write your own</a>, but we'll be using <code>
                    @render.code</code> so that the output text looks cool and
                monospaced-formatted like computer code. You can try stopping
                and re-running your app with other decorators like <code>
                    @render.text</code> to see what happens with other sorts
                of decorators.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taking all that into account, a render function that suits our
            purposes might look like the one below:</p>
        <pre><code>
    @render.code
    def sb_example_text_out():
        return f"You entered '{input.sb_example_text_in()}'."
</code></pre>
        <p>All that's left is to put that function into an app! Fortunately,
            ShinyBroker makes that easy. In practice, when making a real
            trading app, you will probably have tons of different functions
            required to make the app work, perhaps stored in different files,
            doing tasks like calculating your models, updating your charts,
            outputs, and so on. No matter how many you have, you can include
            all your functions in your <code>app</code> simply by wrapping
            them into one overall <strong>server function</strong> that you
            can pass to <code>sb.sb_app()</code> when you build your
            ShinyBroker app. It does not matter what you name your server
            function; the only requirement is that its signature contains the
            five parameters <code>input: Inputs, output: Outputs, session:
                Session, ib_socket, sb_rvs</code>. The part of your app that
            you, the the trader, will write will not always, or even usually,
            make use all five parameters explicitly, but they need to be
            there in your server function so that ShinyBroker can keep track
            of session information in its internals.
        </p>
        <p>Below, we do exactly that: wrap the render function we just wrote
        into a new server function named <code>a_server_function</code>.</p>
        <pre><code>
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, ui, render

# Server to support the new UI
# Signature must always contain the following five parameters:
#   input, output, session, ib_socket, and sb_rvs
def a_server_function(
        input: Inputs, output: Outputs, session: Session, ib_socket, sb_rvs
):
    @render.code
    def sb_example_text_out():
        return f"You entered '{input.sb_example_text_in()}'."
</code></pre>

        <p>And finally... <strong>here comes the magic of
            ShinyBroker</strong>. We can create a new ShinyBroker app by passing
            our ui and server functions as arguments to <code>sb_app</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>
import shinybroker as sb

# Create a ShinyBroker app with the new ui and server
app = sb.sb_app(
    a_piece_of_new_ui,
    a_server_function,
    host='127.0.0.1',
    port=7497,
    client_id=10742
)
</code></pre>
        <p>And that's it! Altogether, the fully completed code example,
            including <code>app.run()</code>, can be found below:</p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code id="hello_sb_2">
import shinybroker as sb
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, ui, render


# Some UI to add to the app
a_piece_of_new_ui = ui.div(
    ui.input_text(
        id='sb_example_text_in',
        label='Example Input. Type something!'
    ),
    ui.output_code('sb_example_text_out')
)


# Server to support the new UI
# Signature must always contain the following five parameters:
#   input, output, session, ib_socket, and sb_rvs
def a_server_function(
        input: Inputs, output: Outputs, session: Session, ib_socket, sb_rvs
):
    @render.code
    def sb_example_text_out():
        return f"You entered '{input.sb_example_text_in()}'."


# Create a ShinyBroker app with the new ui and server
app = sb.sb_app(
    a_piece_of_new_ui,
    a_server_function,
    host='127.0.0.1',
    port=7497,
    client_id=10742
)

app.run()
                        </code></pre>
                <button class="copy-button"
                        onclick="copyCode('hello_sb_2')">
                    Copy Code
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Run your app and view it in a browser like you did in Step 4. You
        should see something like the below in your Home tab, and the
            output should update with whatever you type into the input:</p>
