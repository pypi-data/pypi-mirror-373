Looks up the assets at IBKR whose names or symbols approximately match a search
string. The search string can be the name or part of the name of an asset (e.g.,
 "Apple"), or it can be a ticker (e.g., "AAPL"). Results are separated into
 "stocks" and "bonds". The "stocks" category in this context really means "not
 a bond", and includes contracts such as ETFs, crypto, and futures. The
 "Matching Symbols" tool is useful if you know the name or ticker symbol of an
 asset you're interested in and would like to know its Contract ID, or check the
  exchanges on which it's traded.
