## ⏬ Installation

Choose any of the following methods:

* With [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (requires Python 3.8 or later):

    ```bash
    pip install styro
    ```

* With [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge styro
    ```

* With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```bash
    brew install gerlero/openfoam/styro
    ```

* Standalone binary (installs to `$FOAM_USER_APPBIN`):

    ```bash
    /bin/sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerlero/styro/main/install.sh)"
    ```

To actually install packages, **styro** needs OpenFOAM (from either [openfoam.com](https://www.openfoam.com) or [openfoam.org](https://www.openfoam.org)) and [Git](https://www.openfoam.com/download/git).


## 🧑‍💻 Available commands
- ```styro install <packages>```: Install a package or packages (pass `--upgrade` to upgrade already installed packages)
- ```styro uninstall <packages>```: Uninstall a package or packages
- ```styro freeze```: List installed packages


## 📦 Available packages

### ✨ Indexed packages (OPI)

**styro** is able to install community packages listed in the [OpenFOAM Package Index (OPI)](https://github.com/exasim-project/opi). 

See [here](https://github.com/exasim-project/opi/tree/main/pkg) for the complete list of available packages.

### 🖥️ Local packages

You can also install local packages by passing the path to the package directory:

```bash
styro install /path/to/package
```

For customization, you can add a [`metadata.json`](https://github.com/exasim-project/opi/blob/main/metadata.json) file directly into the package directory.

### 🌎 Git repositories

Installing directly from a Git repository is also supported. E.g.:

```bash
styro install https://github.com/gerlero/reagency.git
```

Same as with local packages, you can add a [`metadata.json`](https://github.com/exasim-project/opi/blob/main/metadata.json) file to the root of the repository to customize the installation.
