**WARNING: This code is in development, is being provided without support, and is subject to change at any time without notification**

This repository provides `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`__ Python API based implementation of the SSEBop ET model.

The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model computes daily total actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using land surface temperature (Ts), maximum air temperature (Ta) and reference ET (ETr or ETo).
The SSEBop model does not solve all the energy balance terms explicitly; rather, it defines the limiting conditions based on "gray-sky" net radiation balance principles and an air temperature parameter.
This approach predefines unique sets of "hot/dry" and "cold/wet" limiting values for each pixel, allowing an operational model setup and a relatively shorter compute time. More information on the GEE implementation of SSEBop is published in Senay2022_ and Senay2023_ with additional details and model assessment.

*Basic SSEBop model implementation in Earth Engine:*

.. image:: docs/SSEBop_GEE_diagram.jpg

Model Design
============

The primary component of the SSEBop model is the Image() class.  The Image class can be used to compute a single fraction of reference ET (ETf) image from a single input image.  The Image class should generally be instantiated from an Earth Engine Landsat image using the collection specific methods listed below.  ET image collections can be built by computing ET in a function that is mapped over a collection of input images.  Please see the `Example Notebooks`_ for more details.

Input Collections
=================

SSEBop ET can currently be computed for Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 (SR/ST) images from the following Earth Engine image collections:

 * LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2
 * LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2
 * LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2
 * LANDSAT/LT05/C02/T1_L2

**Note:** Users are encouraged to prioritize use of Collection 2 data where available. Collection 1 was produced by USGS until 2022-01-01, and maintained by Earth Engine until 2023-01-01. [`More Information <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/landsat#landsat-collection-status>`__]

Landsat Collection 2 SR/ST Input Image
--------------------------------------

To instantiate the class for a Landsat Collection 2 SR/ST image, use the Image.from_landsat_c2_sr method.

The input Landsat image must have the following bands and properties:

=================  ======================================
SPACECRAFT_ID      Band Names
=================  ======================================
LANDSAT_5          SR_B1, SR_B2, SR_B3, SR_B4, SR_B5, SR_B7, ST_B6, QA_PIXEL
LANDSAT_7          SR_B1, SR_B2, SR_B3, SR_B4, SR_B5, SR_B7, ST_B6, QA_PIXEL
LANDSAT_8          SR_B1, SR_B2, SR_B3, SR_B4, SR_B5, SR_B6, SR_B7, ST_B10, QA_PIXEL
LANDSAT_9          SR_B1, SR_B2, SR_B3, SR_B4, SR_B5, SR_B6, SR_B7, ST_B10, QA_PIXEL
=================  ======================================

Model Output
------------

The primary output of the SSEBop model is the fraction of reference ET (ETf).  The actual ET (ETa) can then be computed by multiplying the Landsat-based ETf image with the reference ET (e.g. ETr from GRIDMET).

*Example SSEBop ETa from Landsat:*

.. image:: docs/ET_example.PNG

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import openet.ssebop as ssebop

    landsat_img = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2/LC08_044033_20170716')
    et_fraction = ssebop.Image.from_landsat_c2_sr(landsat_img).et_fraction
    et_reference = ee.Image('IDAHO_EPSCOR/GRIDMET/20170716').select('etr')
    et_actual = et_fraction.multiply(et_reference)

Example Notebooks
=================

Detailed Jupyter Notebooks of the various approaches for calling the OpenET SSEBop model are provided in the "examples" folder.

+ `Computing daily ET for a single Landsat image <examples/single_image.ipynb>`__
+ `Computing a daily ET image collection from Landsat image collection <examples/collection_overpass.ipynb>`__
+ `Computing monthly ET from a collection <examples/collection_interpolate.ipynb>`__

Ancillary Datasets
==================

Land Surface Temperature (LST)
------------------------------
Land Surface Temperature is currently calculated in the SSEBop approach two ways:

* Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 (ST band) images directly. More information can be found at: `USGS Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Science Products <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-2-level-2-science-products>`__

Temperature Difference (dT)
---------------------------
The SSEBop ET model uses dT as a predefined temperature difference between Thot and Tcold for each pixel.
In SSEBop formulation, hot and cold limits are defined on the same pixel; therefore, dT actually represents the vertical temperature difference between the surface temperature of a theoretical bare/dry condition of a given pixel and the air temperature at the canopy level of the same pixel as explained in Senay2018_. The input dT is calculated under "gray-sky" conditions and assumed not to change from year to year, but is unique for each day and location.

Default Asset ID: *projects/usgs-ssebop/dt/daymet_median_v7*

Cold Boundary Temperature (Tcold)
-----------------------------------
In order to determine the theoretical LST corresponding to cold/wet limiting environmental conditions (Tcold), the
SSEBop model uses a Forcing and Normalizing Operation (FANO) method, featuring a linear relation between a normalized
land surface temperature difference and NDVI difference using the dT parameter and a proportionality constant.

More information on parameter design and model improvements using the FANO method can be found in Senay2023_. Additional SSEBop model algorithm theoretical basis documentation can be found `here <https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-9-collection-2-level-3-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-algorithm>`__.

.. code-block:: python

    model_obj = model.Image.from_landsat_c2_sr(
        ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2/LC08_044033_20170716'),
    )

The FANO parameterization allows the establishment of the cold boundary condition regardless of vegetation cover density, improving the performance and operational implementation of the SSEBop ET model in sparsely vegetated landscapes, dynamic growing seasons, and varying locations around the world.

Installation
============

The OpenET SSEBop python module can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install openet-ssebop

Dependencies
============

 * `earthengine-api <https://github.com/google/earthengine-api>`__
 * `openet-core <https://github.com/Open-ET/openet-core>`__

OpenET Namespace Package
========================

Each OpenET model is stored in the "openet" folder (namespace).  The model can then be imported as a "dot" submodule of the main openet module.

.. code-block:: console

    import openet.ssebop as ssebop

Development and Testing
=======================
