- Create or copy a `.aider.conf.yml` into your repo root (preferred) or your home directory (`~/.aider.conf.yml`).
- Start from the `.aider.conf.yml` file in the repository root as a template and adjust to your needs (model, API keys, auto-commit behavior, include/exclude, etc.).
- The server automatically loads `.aider.conf.yml` from your workspace; placing it in the repo root or HOME is sufficient for most workflows.
- Follow [📄 Official Aider documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/config.html) and for detailed descriptions of each option.

## 4️⃣ Generic Workflow
<details>
<summary> <h3> 📄 Show Prompt </h3> </summary>
  
```
# ROLE AND DIRECTIVE

**You are a Senior Software Architect.** Your primary function is to architect software solutions by delegating all code implementation to a stateless coding agent via the `ai_edit` tool. Your expertise lies in meticulous planning, atomic delegation, and rigorous code review, not direct implementation.

---

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

You must adhere to the following five-step, iterative workflow:

1.  **Analyze & Plan:** Thoroughly analyze the user's request and formulate a clear, high-level implementation plan. Break the problem down into the smallest possible, logical, and incremental steps.
2.  **Delegate ONE Step:** Translate **only the very next step** of your plan into a precise, actionable, and fully self-contained prompt for the `ai_edit` tool. **Never bundle multiple steps into a single delegation.** Default to continue_thread = false. Set continue_thread = true only when you intentionally build on the immediately preceding Aider conversation (e.g., iterative refinement of the same change).
3.  **Provide Full Context:** Because the agent is stateless, you must include all necessary context (e.g., file paths, relevant code snippets, class/function definitions) within your `ai_edit` prompt. (See "Agent Memory & Context Protocol" below). Always include file paths, the exact code blocks to modify, and relevant dependencies. This applies whether continue_thread is true or false.
4.  **Review & Verify:** Critically evaluate the diff generated by `ai_edit` after every execution. This is a **mandatory code review**.
    * Does the code correctly implement the single step you delegated?
    * Is the code quality acceptable?
    * Are there any errors or edge cases missed?
5.  **Iterate & Guide:**
    * **If Approved:** The step is complete. Proceed to delegate the *next* incremental step in your plan.
    * **If Revision is Needed:** The implementation is flawed. Provide corrective feedback in a new `ai_edit` prompt, again ensuring all context is provided, to guide the agent to the correct solution for that specific step.

---

# AGENT MEMORY MODEL (CONDITIONAL STATELESSNESS)

- The coding agent can be stateless or continue prior conversation, controlled by ai_edit's required continue_thread flag.
- If continue_thread = false:
  - Aider does not restore prior chat. Treat every call as a fresh agent with no memory.
  - Always include all the immediate context the agent needs: full file paths, the exact function/class to touch, and any dependent snippets.
- If continue_thread = true:
  - Aider restores prior chat history for continuity within the same repo/session.
  - Still include critical context to make the agent robust. Chat history is best-effort and is not a substitute for explicit, precise context.
- Recommended default: continue_thread = false unless you explicitly want to build on the previous Aider conversation.

## Choosing continue_thread
- Set false (recommended):
  - Switching features or tasks
  - After significant repository changes
  - When you want clean isolation between prompts
- Set true:
  - Iterating immediately on the same feature or fix
  - Correcting the previous Aider change
  - Resuming a short-lived session in the same repo

---

# CONSTRAINTS & TOOL PROTOCOL

**Primary Constraint:**
* You are **strictly prohibited** from writing or modifying application code directly. All code implementation must be delegated.
* **Forbidden Tools for Coding:** `apply_diff`, `search_and_replace`, `write_to_file`, and `{your_native_tool_slug}` must NOT be used to modify code.

**Permitted Exception:**
* You MAY use file editing tools to create or modify non-code assets, such as documentation.

**`ai_edit` Tool Usage Rules:**
* `repo_path`: Always pass the full, absolute path of the current working directory.
* `model` / `diff_format`: Do not include these parameters unless explicitly instructed by the user.

## 🙈 Automation-Related Security Considerations

- 🛡️ For automated workflows, always run MCP Servers in isolated environments (🐧[Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) or 🪟[Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie))
- 🗃️ Filesystem access boundaries are maintained via passing `repo_path` to every tool call, so AI assistant only has read/write access to files in the current workspace (relative to any path AI decides to pass as `repo_path` , make sure system prompt is solid on cwd use).
- ⚠️ `execute_command` doesn't have strict access boundaries defined, while it does execute all commands with cwd set to `repo_path` (relative to it), nothing is there to stop AI from passing full paths to other places it seems fit; reading, altering or deleting unintended data on your whole computer, so execise extreme caution with auto-allowing `execute_command` tool or at least don't leave AI assistant unattended while doing so. MCP server is not responsible for your AI assistant executing rm -rf * in your home folder.

## ⁉️ Known Issues and Workarounds

### 💾 Direct Code Editing vs 🤖 AI-assisted Editing

<details>
<summary> <h4> 📃 Show Issue </h4> </summary>

**Issue:**

*    🔍 When using the `write_to_file` tool for direct code editing with languages like JavaScript that utilize template literals, you may encounter unexpected syntax errors. This issue stems from how the AI assistant generates the `content` string, where backticks and dollar signs within template literals might be incorrectly escaped with extra backslashes (`\`).

**Mitigation:** 

*    🔨 The `write_to_file`,`search_and_replace` and `git_apply_diff` tools are dynamically integrated with `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for conditional type checking of `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.ts` files on edit. The output of `tsc --noEmit --allowJs` is provided as part of the tool's response. AI assistants should parse this output to detect any compiler errors and *should not proceed with further actions* if errors are reported, indicating a problem with the written code.

**Workarounds:**

*    🤖 Instruct your AI assistant to delegate editing files to MCP-compatible coding agent by using `ai_edit` tool instead, as it is more suitable for direct code manipulation, automatically commits changes and produces resulting diff as tool output, and let AI assistant act as task orchestrator that will write down plans and docs with `write_to_file` tool then delegate actual coding to specialized agent, get its report (diff) as tool call result, use `git_read_file` tool to double check agent's work, and manage commits and branches (`ai_edit` tool basically integrates `Aider` via some logic ported from [its MCP bridge](https://github.com/sengokudaikon/aider-mcp-server)).

</details>

### ❔ Aider limitations due to its commit-first nature

<details>
<summary> <h4> 📃 Show Issue </h4> </summary>

**Issue:**

*    🔍 When using `ai_edit` tool in a dirty repo state, e.g. during merge or rebase active, it will probably get stuck trying to apply commit.
  
**Workarounds:**

*    ⚙️ Temporarily disable auto commiting functions in your `.aider.conf.yml` configuration file.

### `ai_edit`
- **Description:** AI pair programming tool for making targeted code changes using Aider. Use this tool to:
  1. Implement new features or functionality in existing code
  2. Add tests to an existing codebase
  3. Fix bugs in code
  4. Refactor or improve existing code
  5. Make structural changes across multiple files

  The tool requires:
  - A repository path where the code exists
  - A detailed message describing what changes to make. Please only describe one change per message. If you need to make multiple changes, please submit multiple requests.

  **Edit Format Selection:**
  If the `edit_format` option is not explicitly provided, the default is selected based on the model name:
  - If the model includes `gemini`, defaults to `diff-fenced`
  - If the model includes `gpt`, defaults to `udiff`
  - Otherwise, defaults to `diff`

  Best practices for messages:
  - Be specific about what files or components to modify
  - Describe the desired behavior or functionality clearly
  - Provide context about the existing codebase structure
  - Include any constraints or requirements to follow

  Examples of good messages:
  - "Add unit tests for the Customer class in src/models/customer.rb testing the validation logic"
  - "Implement pagination for the user listing API in the controllers/users_controller.js file"
  - "Fix the bug in utils/date_formatter.py where dates before 1970 aren't handled correctly"
  - "Refactor the authentication middleware in middleware/auth.js to use async/await instead of callbacks"
- **Input Schema:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "repo_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The absolute path to the Git repository's working directory where the AI edit should be performed."
      },
      "message": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "A detailed natural language message describing the code changes to make. Be specific about files, desired behavior, and any constraints."
      },
      "files": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "description": "A list of file paths (relative to the repository root) that Aider should operate on. This argument is mandatory."
      },
      "continue_thread": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "Required. Whether to continue the Aider thread by restoring chat history. If true, passes --restore-chat-history; if false, passes --no-restore-chat-history. Clients must explicitly choose."
      },
      "options": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "description": "Optional. A list of additional command-line options to pass directly to Aider. Each option should be a string."
      },
      "edit_format": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "diff",
          "diff-fenced",
          "udiff",
          "whole"
        ],
        "default": "diff",
        "description": "Optional. The format Aider should use for edits. Defaults to 'diff'. Options: 'diff', 'diff-fenced', 'udiff', 'whole'."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "repo_path",
      "message",
      "files",
      "continue_thread"
    ]
  }
  ```

## Usage examples (stateless vs restored chat)
- Stateless (recommended):
  - continue_thread: false
  - Always include all context needed for the single step.
- With restored chat:
  - continue_thread: true
  - Still include critical context; do not rely solely on chat history.
  - Use this to refine a change made in the immediately previous run.

> Note: When `continue_thread` is false, the server prunes Aider chat memory by truncating `.aider.chat.history.md` in the repository root before invoking Aider.

### `aider_status`
- **Description:** Check the status of Aider and its environment. Use this to:
  1. Verify Aider is correctly installed
  2. Check API keys
  3. View the current configuration
  4. Diagnose connection or setup issues
- **Input Schema:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "repo_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The absolute path to the Git repository or working directory to check Aider's status within."
      },
      "check_environment": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": true,
        "description": "If true, the tool will also check Aider's configuration, environment variables, and Git repository details. Defaults to true."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "repo_path"
    ]
  }
