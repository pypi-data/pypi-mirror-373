mkdl

### How login works 🔐

- Automatic login extracts your existing session from supported browsers (when possible)
- If automatic login fails, switch to manual login from the menu
- If you’re logged in on multiple browsers, you can choose which browser profile to use

---

### Troubleshooting 🧰

- If automatic login doesn’t work, try manual login from the menu
- If a download stops midway, simply run the tool again — it resumes where it left off
- Ensure you have permission to download the course (the tool won’t bypass restrictions)
- Use Python 3.11+ and keep `mkdl` updated: `pip install -U mkdl`
