             copyright owner of any Contribution (defined below) submitted to the
             University. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all
             other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
             with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the
             purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
             indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
             contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
             the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
             “Contribution” means any original work of authorship, including any
             modifications or additions to the Program, that is intentionally submitted
             to the University for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Program. For
             the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic,
             verbal, or written communication sent to the University or its
             representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic

# OpenVCAD
 
> Learn more about the OpenVCAD project at <https://matterassembly.org/openvcad>.

OpenVCAD is an open-source volumetric **multi-material geometry compiler** that bridges the gap between modern multi-material 3D-printing capabilities and computer-aided design (CAD) tools. It enables designers to create objects with complex material distributions for applications such as lattices, meta-materials, medical-image printing, and robotics.

---

## How OpenVCAD Works

1. **Modeling** – Use the `pyvcad` Python package to create a hierarchical tree of geometry + material nodes.
2. **Compilation** – Run an OpenVCAD compiler module to convert the model into volumetric data.
3. **Export** – Output formats include PNG stacks for inkjet printing, FEA meshes for simulation, and meshes for FFF printing.

Key capabilities:

- **Material transitions** – Gradual changes in material properties within one object.
- **Fully implicit representation** – Geometry *and* material are expressed implicitly, scaling to hundreds of billions of voxels.
- **Digital alloying** – Combine materials at a fine scale for intricate compositions.
- **Blending** – Convolution-based smoothing across complex material interfaces.
- **Image-based processing** – Drive material distributions from images (e.g., medical scans).

---
## Getting Started
The code below shows how you can create a basic OpenVCAD design, render it, and export a PNG stack for Inkjet 3D Printing.
```python
import pyvcad as pv
import pyvcad_compilers as pvc
import pyvcadviz as viz

# Load some material definitions
materials = pv.default_materials
red = materials.id("red")
green = materials.id("green")
liquid = materials.id("liquid")

# Create pyvcad object
radius = 5
center = pv.Vec3(0,0,0)
sphere = pv.Sphere(center, radius, liquid)

# Render the object, note that this is a blocking call and will not continue until the window is closed
viz.Render(root=sphere, material_defs=materials, use_darkmode=True)

# Export a PNG stack
voxel_size = pv.Vec3(0.1,0.1,0.1) # This is mm. Use (0.0423, 0.0846, 0.027) for the J750
output_directory = "png_stack_output"
file_prefix = "my_stack_"
use_liquid_keepout = False
liquid_keepout_distance = 0

png_exporter = pvc.DirectMaterialCompiler(sphere, voxel_size, materials, output_directory, file_prefix, use_liquid_keepout, liquid_keepout_distance)
png_exporter.compile()
```

## Examples
You can download a ZIP file containing more examples [here](https://o365coloradoedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/maccurdy_colorado_edu/EREhMep4JgJArrNZNwIhnY0Brcu1kjzu7cpE5C-YstwtlA?e=9JeB37). Note that these examples just provide object definitions. You will need to add the follow snipped to render:
```python
import pyvcadviz as viz

# --- Demo object here ---

viz.Render(root=root, material_defs=materials, use_darkmode=True)
```

## Issues
If you run into any issues, please submit a report [here](https://github.com/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/issues).
> Note: Currently we only support Windows. We hope to release Linux and Mac binaries soon.

---

## Source Code
We hope to release the source code soon!

## What OpenVCAD **Is Not**

OpenVCAD is **not** a voxel-by-voxel design tool. While it can emit voxel data, design is done implicitly with high-level math expressions that scale to extremely large builds (e.g. Inkjet 3D printing).
