    Added support for `microversion 2.94`_. There are no client-side changes
    for this microversion, but sending this microversion allows the
    ``hostname`` parameter in the server create, server update, and server
    rebuild APIs to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Prior to this
    microversion, server-side validation only allows short names as the
    ``hostname``.
