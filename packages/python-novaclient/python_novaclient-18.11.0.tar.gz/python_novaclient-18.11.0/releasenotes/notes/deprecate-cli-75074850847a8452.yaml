deprecations:
  - |
    The ``nova`` CLI is now deprecated. This is the signal that it is
    time to start using the openstack CLI. No new features will be
    added to the ``nova`` CLI, though fixes to the CLI will be assessed
    on a case by case basis. Fixes to the API bindings, development of
    new API bindings, and changes to the compute commands in the openstack
    CLI are exempt from this deprecation.
