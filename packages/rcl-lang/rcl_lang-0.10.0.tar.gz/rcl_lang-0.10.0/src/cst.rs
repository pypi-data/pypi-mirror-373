//! The Concrete Syntax Tree.
//!
//! The Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) is one level lower than the Abstract Syntax
//! Tree (AST). It represents the input document more precisely, which makes it
//! less suitable to feed into a typechecker or evaluator, but more suitable for
//! to feed into an autoformatter. For instance, it preserves comments.
//!
//! The CST does not account for every byte in the input document. For example,
//! it does not record whitespace that it would not respect anyway when
//! formatting, and it does not record the spans for some keywords that are
//! implied by the structure of the tree. For example, for a let-binding, it
//! does not store the span of the `let` keyword nor of the `=` after the name.
