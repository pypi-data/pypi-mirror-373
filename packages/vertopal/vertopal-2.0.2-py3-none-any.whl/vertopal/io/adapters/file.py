# Description:
#   Adapters for reading from and writing to file system paths,
#   implementing Vertopal's Readable, Writable, and PathWritable
#   protocols for binary I/O operations.

"""
File-based stream adapters for Vertopal's I/O protocols.

This module provides adapters that implement Vertopal's readable and
writable I/O protocols backed by file system paths. Use these types when
your source or sink is a local file.

Example:

    Read a file through the Readable protocol:

    >>> from vertopal.io.adapters.file import FileInput
    >>> src = FileInput("input.txt")
    >>> with src.open() as f:
    ...     data = f.read()

    Write to a file through the Writable protocol:

    >>> from vertopal.io.adapters.file import FileOutput
    >>> out = FileOutput("output.txt")
    >>> with out.open() as f:
    ...     _ = f.write(b"hello")
"""
