Type aliases for Vertopal CLI and package modules.

This module defines common type aliases used throughout the Vertopal
CLI and Python package, including the `PathType` union for file system
paths. These aliases improve type clarity and compatibility with
standard library and OS interfaces.

# Type alias for file system paths.
# Represents either a string path or an object implementing the
# `os.PathLike` protocol (such as `pathlib.Path`).
# Used for parameters and attributes that accept file system paths in
# Vertopal CLI and library modules.
