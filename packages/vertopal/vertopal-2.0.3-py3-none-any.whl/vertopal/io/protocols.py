#   Core I/O protocol definitions for Vertopal, including abstract

"""
I/O protocol definitions for readable and writable streams.

These protocols abstract byte-oriented sources and sinks used across
Vertopal package. They enable structural typing for adapters such as
file, pipe, and in-memory readers and writers.
