**Pywen** is a Python CLI tool based on **Qwen3-Coder**, designed specifically for intelligent software engineering tasks. It provides a conversational interface that can understand natural language instructions and execute complex development workflows through an advanced agent system.

## 🧬 Recent Updates

- 2025.08.26 Updated the `/agent` module by adding the Claude Code agent, with execution logic aligned to Claude Code, and introducing dedicated tools such as the task tool and todowrite tool. You can switch to the Claude Code agent using `/agent claude`.
- 2025.08.08: Updated the `/agent` switch agent module, added DeepResearch agent, with execution logic aligned with Google's open-source DeepResearch LangGraph version. You can use `/agent research` to switch GeminiResearchDemo agent.Before you use it, please make sure you have the serper api key.
- 2025.08.06: Released the first version of Pywen, with execution logic aligned with Gemini CLI/Qwen Code

## 📖 User Guide

### Command Line Interface

#### Available Commands

```bash
# System commands
/about       show version info
/auth        change the auth method
/clear       clear the screen and conversation history
/help        for help on pywen code
/memory      Commands for interacting with memory.show
  Show       the current memory contents.add
  Add        content to the memory.refresh
  Refresh    the memory from the source.
/stats       check session stats. Usage:/stats         
/tools       list available Pywen tools 
/bug         submit a bug report
/quit        exit the cli
!            shell command                                  

# Special commands
!<command>    - Execute shell command

# Keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl+Y        - Toggle YOLO mode (auto-approve all operations - use with caution!)

# Direct input of task descriptions to execute agent
```

### YOLO Mode

**Use with caution:**
- Press `Ctrl+Y` to toggle YOLO mode
- **Default behavior**: All tool calls require user confirmation for safety
- In YOLO mode, all tool calls are automatically approved without user confirmation
- This speeds up execution but removes safety checks
- Mode status is displayed in the interface
- You can also type 'a' (always) when prompted for tool confirmation to enable YOLO mode

### Configuration Management

Pywen uses the `pywen_config.json` file for configuration:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "qwen",
  "max_steps": 20,
  "enable_lakeview": false,
  "model_providers": {
    "qwen": {
      "api_key": "your-qwen-api-key",
      "base_url": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
      "model": "qwen3-coder-plus",
      "max_tokens": 4096,
      "temperature": 0.5
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Priority:**
1. Command line arguments (highest)
2. Configuration file values
3. Environment variables
4. Default values (lowest)

### Environment Variables

You can set API keys through environment variables:

```bash
# Qwen (required)
export QWEN_API_KEY="your-qwen-api-key"

# Tool API Keys (optional but recommended)
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"  # For web search

## 🔌 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Pywen also supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to connect external tools and services such as playwright.

### Enabling MCP
1. Open your configuration file:
   ```bash
   ~/.pywen/pywen_config.json
   ```
2. Locate the `mcp` section and enable it:
   ```json
   "mcp": {
       "enabled": true,
           "isolated": true,
           "servers": [
           {
               "name": "playwright",
               "command": "npx",
               "args": [
                   "@playwright/mcp@latest"
               ],
               "enabled": true,
               "include": [
                   "browser_*"
               ],
               "save_images_dir": "./outputs/playwright",
               "isolated": true 
           }
           ]
   }

   ```
### Node.js 
Ensure that you have Node.js installed. You can verify it with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```
If you don’t have it installed, please follow the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/).

### Browser Dependency
If your device does not have a browser installed, install browser for Playwright with:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

After enabling MCP and installing the required browser, Pywen will be able to call the `playwright` MCP server for tasks like browser automation, screenshot capture, and web interaction.

## 📊 Trajectory Recording

Pywen automatically records detailed execution trajectories for debugging and analysis:

```bash
# Trajectory files are automatically saved to trajectories/ directory
trajectories/trajectory_xxxxxx.json
```

Trajectory files contain:
- **LLM Interactions**: All messages, responses, and tool calls
- **Agent Steps**: State transitions and decision points
- **Tool Usage**: Which tools were called and their results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, token usage, and execution metrics

## 📈 Session Statistics

Monitor your usage with real-time statistics:

```bash
> /stats
```

Tracks:
- API calls and token consumption
- Tool usage patterns
- Session duration
- Model performance metrics
