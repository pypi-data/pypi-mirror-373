GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                                              Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>                              Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed                           to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,                             the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to forbid the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or indirectly liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without a fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list would satisfy this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the standard form of
the Operating System in which the work runs, or (b) is included in the
standard form of a compiler or other tool used to produce the work, or
(c) serves a function which, after the work has been conveyed, is used
to make a covered work, and which is not a part of the covered work
itself. The System Libraries do not include anything other than a part
of the Standard Libraries that is included in the covered work only as a
matter of convenience, or which the covered work is designed to include
as a part of the covered work itself.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work do not include anything
which is not a part of the Standard Libraries that is included in the
covered work as a matter of convenience, or which the covered work is
designed to include as a part of the covered work itself.

  The "Standard Libraries" of a covered work include anything that is
included in the standard form of a compiler or other tool used to
produce the covered work, or a part of a standard form of a compiler or
other tool used to produce the covered work. The "Standard Libraries" of
a covered work do not include anything else. The "Standard Libraries"
of a covered work do not include anything that is not a part of a
standard form of a compiler or other tool used to produce the covered
work. The "Standard Libraries" of a covered work do not include anything
that is not a part of the standard form of a compiler or other tool used
to produce the covered work, and that is included in the covered work as
a matter of convenience.

  The "Standard Libraries" of a covered work do not include anything
that is not a part of a standard form of a compiler or other tool used
to produce the covered work. The "Standard Libraries" of a covered work
do not include anything that is not a part of a standard form of a
compiler or other tool used to produce the covered work.

  A "Component" is a work that is not the covered work, and that, when
combined with the covered work, constitutes a larger work.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or indirectly liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without a fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list would satisfy this criterion.

  2. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence
of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along
with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of conveying a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 1,
provided that you also meet these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry a notice stating that it is released under
    this License, and that you have obtained a copy of this License.

    c) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

    d) The work must carry a notice stating that it is distributed under
    the terms of this License, and that it may be used and distributed
    in accordance with the terms of this License.

    e) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

    f) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

  4. Conveying Object Code.

  You may convey the covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 1 and 2, provided that you also meet these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you have
    obtained a copy of the License, and that the original work is
    licensed under this License as well.

    b) The work must carry a notice stating that it is distributed under
    the terms of this License, and that it may be used and distributed
    in accordance with the terms of this License.

    c) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

    d) The work must carry a notice stating that it is distributed under
    the terms of this License, and that it may be used and distributed
    in accordance with the terms of this License.

    e) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

    f) The work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed under
    this License, and that the original work is licensed under this
    License as well.

  5. Conveying Combined Works.

  You may convey a "combined work" that is a covered work combined with
other works not based on the covered work, provided that you meet these
conditions:

    a) The combined work must carry prominent notices stating that you
    have obtained a copy of the License, and that the original work is
    licensed under this License as well.

    b) The combined work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed
    under this License, and that the original work is licensed under
    this License as well.

    c) The combined work must carry a notice stating that it is
    distributed under the terms of this License, and that it may be used
    and distributed in accordance with the terms of this License.

    d) The combined work must carry a notice stating that it is licensed
    under this License, and that the original work is licensed under
    this License as well.

    e) The combined work must carry a notice stating that it is
    licensed under this License, and that the original work is licensed
    under this License as well.

    f) The combined work must carry a notice stating that it is
    licensed under this License, and that the original work is licensed
    under this License as well.

  6. Termination.

  Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you
violate any of the terms of this License.

  7. Future Versions.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a certain version number of the GNU General Public License to
apply to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
of that version or any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  8. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  9. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
