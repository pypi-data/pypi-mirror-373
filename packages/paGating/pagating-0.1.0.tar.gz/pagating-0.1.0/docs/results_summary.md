# paMishU Experimental Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of our experiments with the `paMishU` gating unit, which uses the Mish activation function as its gating mechanism. We conducted experiments to compare:
1. The performance of `paMishU` against other paGating units
2. The impact of different alpha values on `paMishU` performance
3. The effect of using learnable alpha parameters

## Comparison with Other paGating Units
We compared the performance of `paMishU` with the following units, all using alpha=0.5:

| Unit | Test Loss |
|------|-----------|
| paGLU | 61.94 |
| paGTU | 60.00 |
| paSwishU | 67.94 |
| paReGLU | 67.57 |
| paGELU | 68.44 |
| paMishU | 67.81 |
| paSiLU | 67.94 |

Based on these results, `paGTU` (tanh gating) performed the best, followed by `paGLU` (sigmoid gating). The `paMishU` implementation performed comparably to `paSwishU`, `paReGLU`, `paGELU`, and `paSiLU`.

## About the Mish Activation Function
The Mish activation function used in `paMishU` is defined as:

```
f(x) = x * tanh(softplus(x)) = x * tanh(ln(1 + e^x))
```

Mish has several notable properties:
- It is smooth and non-monotonic
- It is unbounded above and bounded below
- It preserves small negative values, unlike ReLU
- It avoids saturation in the positive domain, unlike sigmoid and tanh

Compared to other activation functions used in paGating:
- Unlike ReLU (used in paReGLU), Mish is differentiable everywhere
- Unlike sigmoid (used in paGLU), Mish doesn't saturate as quickly for large positive values
- Unlike tanh (used in paGTU), Mish is unbounded in the positive domain
- Similar to Swish/SiLU (used in paSwishU/paSiLU), but with different behavior around zero

In our experiments, Mish performed competitively but didn't outperform simpler gating mechanisms like tanh and sigmoid for the synthetic regression task.

## Effect of Alpha Value on paMishU Performance
We tested `paMishU` with different alpha values to determine the optimal setting:

| Alpha Value | Test Loss |
|-------------|-----------|
| 0.0 | 62.83 |
| 0.2 | 64.20 |
| 0.5 | 67.81 |
| 0.8 | 70.65 |
| 1.0 | 69.94 |

Interestingly, lower alpha values (0.0-0.2) resulted in better performance for `paMishU`. This suggests that for the synthetic regression task used in our experiments, the Mish gating mechanism might be less effective than a simpler approach.

## Learnable Alpha Parameter
When using a learnable alpha parameter (initialized at 0.5), the model converged to an alpha value of approximately 0.35 after 10 epochs, with a final test loss of 77.74. The learned alpha being relatively low is consistent with our observation that lower alpha values performed better for this specific task.

## Conclusions
1. The `paMishU` implementation functions correctly and can be successfully integrated with the paGating framework.
2. For the synthetic regression task, simpler gating mechanisms (paGTU, paGLU) outperformed more complex ones including `paMishU`.
3. Performance of `paMishU` appears to be better with lower alpha values for this particular task.
4. The learnable alpha parameter effectively adjusts during training, finding an optimum value for the specific task.

## Future Work
1. Test `paMishU` on real-world datasets and complex tasks where more sophisticated activation functions might show advantages.
2. Explore different initialization strategies for the learnable alpha parameter.
3. Investigate the combination of `paMishU` with different normalization techniques (pre-norm, post-norm, gate-norm).
4. Compare the computational efficiency of `paMishU` against other gating units for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
5. Study the effect of Mish activation in preserving gradient flow during training of very deep networks compared to other activation functions.

## Transformer Model Results
We tested all paGating units in a transformer model architecture for a sequence classification task. This evaluation assesses how effectively different gating mechanisms perform within complex neural network architectures compared to simpler regression tasks.

### Detailed Performance Results

| Unit | Test Accuracy | Test Loss | Final Training Accuracy | Training Convergence |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| paGTU | 97.50% | 0.0530 | 97.80% | Steady improvement with consistent performance |
| paMishU | 95.50% | 0.0892 | 98.20% | Fast initial learning, stable throughout |
| paSwishU | 95.50% | 0.0892 | 98.20% | Rapid improvement, especially in later epochs |
| paSiLU | 95.50% | 0.0892 | 98.20% | Similar pattern to paSwishU |
| paGLU | 94.00% | 0.1253 | 97.80% | More fluctuation in training metrics |
| paReGLU | 93.50% | 0.1352 | 97.70% | Inconsistent learning rate with some spikes |
| paGELU | 93.50% | 0.1606 | 98.20% | Strong final training accuracy despite higher test loss |

### Key Observations
1. **Overall Performance**: All paGating units performed well in the transformer architecture, achieving >93% accuracy on the test set.

2. **Best Performer**: `paGTU` (tanh gating) demonstrated the highest performance with 97.5% test accuracy and the lowest test loss (0.0530), consistent with our observations in the simple regression task.

3. **Strong Contenders**: `paMishU`, `paSwishU`, and `paSiLU` all achieved identical 95.5% accuracy and test loss metrics, forming a clear second tier of performance.

4. **Training Dynamics**: 
   - Most units reached >95% training accuracy by epoch 5
   - `paGTU` showed the most consistent improvement curve
   - `paGELU` achieved excellent training accuracy (98.2%) but had higher generalization gap

5. **Generalization**: The gap between training and test accuracy was smallest for `paGTU` (0.3%), indicating better generalization capabilities.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: 
   - The advanced activation functions (Mish, Swish, SiLU) performed nearly identically in this task
   - ReLU-based and GELU-based gating showed similar test performance
   - Sigmoid gating (paGLU) performed slightly better than ReLU and GELU variants

7. **Performance Clustering**: The results show three distinct performance tiers:
   - Tier 1: `paGTU` (97.5%)
   - Tier 2: `paMishU`, `paSwishU`, `paSiLU` (all 95.5%)
   - Tier 3: `paGLU`, `paReGLU`, `paGELU` (93.5-94.0%)

These comprehensive results suggest that `paGTU` with tanh activation provides the best gating mechanism for transformer models in this specific sequence classification task. However, the Mish-based `paMishU` demonstrates competitive performance, particularly for a newer activation function that may offer additional benefits in other contexts or more complex tasks.
