We evaluate paGLU on WikiText-103 language modeling using GPT-2 Small (124M parameters). The model is trained for up to 20,000 steps with a learning rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 8. We compare the baseline GPT-2 implementation against paGLU with $\alpha=0.0$ to verify baseline equivalence.

\textbf{Setup:} Experiments are conducted on Apple M4 Mac Mini (16GB RAM, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU) with MPS acceleration. We use the standard WikiText-103 train/validation split and report perplexity on the validation set.

\textbf{Results:} Table~\ref{tab:verified_nlp_results} shows that paGLU with $\alpha=0.0$ achieves equivalent performance to the baseline GPT-2, with evaluation loss of 1.776 vs 1.781 (0.28\% difference, within experimental noise). This confirms that our parameterization correctly reduces to the standard implementation when $\alpha=0$.

The framework demonstrates zero computational overhead, adding no parameters or FLOPs while maintaining identical convergence behavior. Training stability is preserved across all tested configurations.
