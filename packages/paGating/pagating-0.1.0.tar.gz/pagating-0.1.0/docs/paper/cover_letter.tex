\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled \textbf{"paGating: A Parameterized Activation Gating Framework for Flexible and Efficient Neural Networks for GenAI"} for consideration for publication in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems.

\textbf{\large Research Contribution and Significance}

\vspace{0.5em}

This work introduces paGating, a unified framework that addresses a fundamental challenge in neural network design: the rigid nature of activation functions. Our contribution is threefold:

\textbf{1. Unified Theoretical Framework}: We present the first comprehensive framework that unifies gated activation functions through a single parameterization scheme. The framework encompasses nine distinct activation units (paGLU, paGTU, paSwishU, paReGLU, paGELU, paMishU, paSiLUU, paSiLU, and paGRU) under a common mathematical foundation with the tunable parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$.

\textbf{2. Empirical Validation Across Domains}: Our extensive experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple domains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language Modeling}: 1.9\% improvement in evaluation loss on GPT-2 Small with WikiText-103
    \item \textbf{Image Classification}: 1.9 percentage point improvement on CIFAR-10 with ResNet variants
    \item \textbf{Hardware Efficiency}: 3.11Ã— speedup on Apple M4 with 15\% memory reduction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Production-Ready Implementation}: Unlike many research frameworks, paGating provides immediate practical value through comprehensive ONNX and CoreML export pipelines, enabling deployment across diverse hardware platforms from mobile devices to cloud infrastructure.

\textbf{\large Technical Innovation}

\vspace{0.5em}

The key innovation lies in our parameterized interpolation mechanism: $f_{\alpha}(x) = x \cdot (\alpha \cdot g(x) + (1-\alpha))$, where $g(x)$ represents various gating functions. This simple yet powerful formulation enables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Continuous Activation Space}: Smooth interpolation between linear ($\alpha=0$) and fully gated ($\alpha=1$) behaviors
    \item \textbf{Learnable Adaptation}: Dynamic optimization of activation characteristics during training
    \item \textbf{Zero Parameter Overhead}: When using fixed $\alpha$ values, no additional parameters are introduced
    \item \textbf{Hardware Optimization}: Efficient implementations leveraging platform-specific optimizations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\large Reproducibility and Open Science}

\vspace{0.5em}

We are committed to reproducible research and open science principles. Our submission includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Repository}: Complete implementation available at \url{https://github.com/aaryanguglani/paGating}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Testing}: 93\% test coverage with continuous integration across multiple platforms
    \item \textbf{Detailed Documentation}: Extensive reproducibility guides and implementation details
    \item \textbf{Production Deployment}: Ready-to-use export pipelines for ONNX and CoreML formats
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\large Relevance to IEEE TNNLS}

\vspace{0.5em}

This work aligns perfectly with IEEE TNNLS's scope and mission:

\textbf{Neural Network Architectures}: We advance the fundamental understanding of activation functions in neural networks, providing both theoretical insights and practical improvements.

\textbf{Learning Systems}: The framework demonstrates how parameterized activations can enhance learning across diverse tasks and architectures.

\textbf{Practical Impact}: Our production-ready implementation bridges the gap between research innovation and real-world deployment, addressing a critical need in the field.

\textbf{Broad Applicability}: The framework's domain-agnostic nature makes it valuable for the diverse IEEE TNNLS readership, from computer vision to natural language processing researchers.

\textbf{\large Experimental Rigor}

\vspace{0.5em}

Our experimental methodology follows rigorous standards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Statistical Validation}: Multiple independent runs with different random seeds, paired t-tests, and effect size analysis
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Baselines}: Systematic comparison against identity mappings and standard activation functions
    \item \textbf{Multi-Domain Validation}: Evaluation across language modeling, image classification, and hardware benchmarking
    \item \textbf{Ablation Studies}: Detailed analysis of the $\alpha$ parameter's impact across different values and learning strategies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\large Broader Impact}

\vspace{0.5em}

The paGating framework has significant implications for the neural networks community:

\textbf{Research Acceleration}: Researchers can easily experiment with different gating mechanisms without implementing each from scratch.

\textbf{Production Deployment}: The framework's export capabilities enable immediate deployment in production environments.
