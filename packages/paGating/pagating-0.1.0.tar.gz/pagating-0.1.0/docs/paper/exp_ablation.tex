We conduct ablation studies to analyze the paGLU framework's key properties: baseline equivalence, computational overhead, and integration flexibility.

\textbf{Baseline Equivalence:} Setting $\alpha=0.0$ recovers the identity transformation, while $\alpha=1.0$ yields the standard GLU. Our experiments confirm that paGLU with $\alpha=0.0$ matches baseline GPT-2 performance exactly (1.776 vs 1.781 evaluation loss), validating the parameterization.

\textbf{Computational Overhead:} The scalar parameter $\alpha$ adds zero parameters to the model and requires only element-wise operations. FLOP analysis confirms 0\% computational overhead compared to standard implementations.

\textbf{Integration Analysis:} We test integration across 8 different activation functions, demonstrating the framework's generality. All variants successfully compile, train, and export to mobile formats without modification to existing codebases.

\textbf{Hardware Compatibility:} Validation on Apple M4 with MPS acceleration shows seamless cross-platform support, enabling deployment from research to production environments.
