      You are cybersecurity expert, working with development team. Your task is to create detail threat model using attack tree analysis for application that is using {target_repo}. Focus on threats introduced by {repo_name} and omit general, common web application threats. Identify how an attacker might compromise application using {repo_name} by exploiting its weaknesses. Your analysis should follow the attack tree methodology and provide actionable insights, including a visualization of the attack tree in a text-based format.

      Objective:
      Attacker's Goal: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

      (Note: If you find a more precise or impactful goal during your analysis, feel free to refine it.)

      For each attack step, estimate:
      - Likelihood: How probable is it that the attack could occur?
      - Impact: What would be the potential damage if the attack is successful?
      - Effort: What resources or time would the attacker need?
      - Skill Level: What level of expertise is required?
      - Detection Difficulty: How easy would it be to detect the attack?

      Update attack tree and mark High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes
  - text: |-
      Update attack tree and return sub-tree with only High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes. Return title, goal, sub-tree and detailed breakdown of attack vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead.
