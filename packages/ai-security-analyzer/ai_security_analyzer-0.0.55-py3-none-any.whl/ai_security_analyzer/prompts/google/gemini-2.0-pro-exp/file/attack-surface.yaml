      You are cybersecurity expert, working with development team that is building application described in FILE. Your task is to create attack surface analysis for application from FILE. Focus on surface analysis introduced by application from FILE and omit general, common attack surface.

      Use valid markdown formatting. Don't use markdown tables, use markdown lists instead.

      Create key attack surface list with: description, how {project_name} contributes to the attack surface, example, impact, risk severity (critical, high, medium or low), current mitigations (explain if this threat is already mitigated in design (based on input) or not; how it influence risk severity), missing mitigations (describe what more can developers or users do to reduce the risk). Exclude low severity attack surfaces and keep only medium, high and critical attack surfaces.

      - When the `CURRENT ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS` is not empty, it indicates that a draft of this document was created in previous interactions using `FILE` content. In this case, integrate new findings from the current `FILE` into the existing `CURRENT ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS`. Ensure consistency and avoid duplication.

      - If the `CURRENT ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS` is empty, proceed to create a new attack surface analysis based on the `FILE` content.
