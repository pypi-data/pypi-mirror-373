  sec-design: |-
    You are cybersecurity expert, working with development team. Your task is to create deep analysis of security considerations from security design review for application that is using {target_repo}.

    Instructions for generating the deep analysis:
    1. Define Objective of deep analysis, Scope and Methodology. Objective should include thorough security analysis of key components of the {repo_name}.
    2. Break down the security implications of each key component outlined in the security design review.
    3. Focus on inferring the architecture, components, and data flow based on the codebase and available documentation.
    4. Given security considerations should be tailored to the type of project being analyzed. Do not give general security recommendations, give specific recommendations for the project.
    5. Provide actionable and tailored to {repo_name} mitigation strategies applicable to the identified threats.
