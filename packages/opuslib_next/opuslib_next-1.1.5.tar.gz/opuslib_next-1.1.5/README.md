# **python-opus**

Python bindings to the libopus, IETF low-delay audio codec

**Usage**  
------------

The usage remains the same as the original `opuslib`, except that now the library is called `opuslib_next`. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install opuslib-next
```

After installation, you can import and use it like before:

```python
import opuslib_next
# your code here
```

**About the Fork**  
------------

Since the original author of [opuslib](https://github.com/orion-labs/opuslib) has not maintained or updated the library for a long time, I decided to fork and update it to fix issues.

**Contributing**  
-------------

If you want to contribute, please follow the [pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guideline and include tests.
