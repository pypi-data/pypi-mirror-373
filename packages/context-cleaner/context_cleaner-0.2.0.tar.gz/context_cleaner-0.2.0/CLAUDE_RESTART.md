### 📍 Current Position
- On `main` branch with all PR17 changes merged
- Ready to proceed with next phase of development

### 🎯 Next Task: PR18 - Safety & Validation Framework

According to our reorganized DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md:

**PR18: Safety & Validation Framework** (Days 4-6)
- Enhanced backup and rollback system with operation history
- Advanced safety validation with multi-layered risk assessment
- Dry-run preview mode with before/after visualization
- Transaction-based operations with atomic rollback capabilities
- Safety report generation with detailed impact analysis
- User confirmation workflows for risky operations
- Integration with existing ManipulationValidator from PR17
- **Dependencies**: Built on PR17 manipulation engine
- **Testing Target**: 98% code coverage with comprehensive safety scenario testing
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

### 🔧 Implementation Plan for PR18
1. Create new branch: `feature/pr18-safety-validation-framework`
2. Extend existing ManipulationValidator with enhanced safety features
3. Implement backup/rollback system with operation history
4. Create dry-run preview system with visual diff
5. Build transaction-based atomic operations
6. Enhanced safety reporting with detailed analysis
7. User confirmation workflows for high-risk operations
8. Comprehensive testing (98% coverage target)
9. Integration testing with PR17 manipulation engine

### 📂 Key Files to Work With
- `src/context_cleaner/core/manipulation_validator.py` - Extend existing validator
- `src/context_cleaner/core/manipulation_engine.py` - Integration points
- Create new: `src/context_cleaner/core/backup_manager.py`
- Create new: `src/context_cleaner/core/transaction_manager.py`
- Create new: `src/context_cleaner/core/preview_generator.py`
- Extend tests in `tests/core/` directory

### 🚀 Ready Commands
```bash
# Create new branch for PR18
git checkout -b feature/pr18-safety-validation-framework

# Verify current state
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### 📊 Project Health
- All core analysis infrastructure complete (PR15.1-15.3, PR16)
- Core manipulation engine implemented and tested (PR17)
- Reorganized development roadmap with clear PR dependencies
- Strong testing foundation (145/157 tests passing across analysis components)
- Ready for safety enhancement phase
