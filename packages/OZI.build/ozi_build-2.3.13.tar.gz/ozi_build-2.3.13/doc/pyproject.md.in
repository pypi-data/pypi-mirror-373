# Configuration

OZI.build only supports reading configuration from `pyproject.toml`.
This file lives at the root of the module/package, at the same place
as the toplevel `meson.build` file.

## Build system table

This tells tools like pip to build your project with flit. It's a standard
defined by PEP 517. For any project using OZI.build, it will look something like this:

``` toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["OZI.build[core]~=1.9"]
    build-backend = "ozi_build.buildapi"
```

## Project table

This holds the essential project metadata that is outside of the ``meson.build`` file.
Some keys remain in the project table for improved cross-compatibility.
It should look similar to this in an OZI.build project:

``` toml
    [project]
    name = "project_name"
    dynamic = ["version"]
    dependencies = [
    'TAP-Producer~=1.0.4',
    ]

    [project.license]
    file = "LICENSE.txt"

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    ...
```

> NOTE: The project version and name are extracted from the `meson.build`
> [`project()`](http://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#project) table.
