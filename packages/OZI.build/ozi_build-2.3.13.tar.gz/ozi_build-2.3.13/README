This is the `OZI-Project <https://github.com/OZI-Project>`_ maintained fork of the mesonpep517 0.2 tag.

This is a module that implements PEP-517 for the meson build system.

This means that you only need to provide a ``pyproject.toml`` and a
``meson.build`` in your project source root to be able to create a wheel
for the project and to publish your project on PyPI.

Other features include:

* `signing wheels <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#signed-wheel-files>`_ with JOSE JWS
* compiling modules to bytecode with pyc_wheel
* scanning ``pyproject.toml`` for exploitable ReDoS patterns with regexploit

For more information have a look at `the documentation <https://docs.oziproject.dev/en/stable/ozi_build.html>`_
