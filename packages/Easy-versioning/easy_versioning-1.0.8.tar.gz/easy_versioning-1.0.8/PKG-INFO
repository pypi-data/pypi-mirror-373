# Easy Versioning (Sphinx documentation build tool)
  
This tool was created to address the need to add **versioning to a Sphinx** project without relying on Read the Docs (RTD).  
  
This Python script automates the full workflow of **preparing, versioning, building, and organizing documentation from Markdown** files using the Sphinx tool.  

It’s designed for teams and organizations who want to **self-host** their documentation sites and prefer full control over the hosting environment and theme customization.  
Easy Versioning works as an **alternative approach** for managing versioned and multilingual docs, complementing existing Sphinx workflows in a simple way with only one tool.

By organizing your source files in the expected structure, this tool actively builds your documentation with Sphinx and outputs a fully ready-to-deploy static site.  
With minimal setup, it streamlines the process of managing multiple versions and languages, adding consistent footers, and arranging build artifacts for deployment.

## Features

Easy Versioning offers the following key features:

-  **Manage multiple documentation versions**
-  **Support multiple languages** for each version
-  **Add custom footers** showing version and language info
-  **Security** by ensuring a safe fallback to an existing page so users are always redirected properly
-  **Build documentation automatically** using Sphinx for every version and language
-  **Organize generated HTML files** into a clean, ready-to-deploy structure
-  **Support for both ".md" and ".rst" files**

You can find a fully working example of a `Footer.html` file in the `Example/data` folder of this project.  
You can start by copying the default file in your `data/` folder and then customize it as you wish by modifying the CSS.  
If you want to create your own `Footer.html` file, please follow the placeholder tags as shown in the example in the folder.

<br>

Inside the `src/` folder, place all your documentation projects you want to build organized according to the directory structure shown above.

<br>

You can find a complete example project in the `Example/` folder, which you can download, build, and use as a setup for your own project!

## How to use it

By downloading the `Example/` folder in this repository, you can access the official Easy_versioning documentation.   
It includes detailed guides in Italian, English, and German, additionally, you can test the final output, as the documentation itself was built using this tool.  

You can find a simple and easy documentation below:   

The tool requires the directory structure shown above.  
You can use the `easy-versioning-setup` command to set up the folders with the correct layout for an easy-versioning project. This function takes two parameters as input: the project name and the author name, which are used to set up the Sphinx project, if no arguments are provided the default name is gonna be "Documentation" and the author "Author".   
After opening a terminal in the project’s source directory (which contains the `data/` and `src/` folders), run the command `easy-versioning-build` to build your project.

This command can be run without any arguments, or with up to two arguments:

1. **Default language:** The fallback language and the main language of the project (default is "English"). If no arguments are provided, make sure there is an "English" folder in every version of the documentation. Choose a language that exists in **all** versions of your documentation.  
2. **Cleanup flag:** A boolean flag (default is True) that controls whether the `_source` directory is removed from the final build to reduce the project size.  
   - Set this flag to `0` to disable cleanup and keep the `_source` directory.

Examples:  
- `easy-versioning-build` — Uses English as the default language and removes the `_source` directory.  
- `easy-versioning-build Italiano 0` — Sets Italian as the default language and keeps the `_source` directory intact.

This tool is not a replacement for ReadTheDocs but rather a **complementary free solution** for teams who prefer to host their own documentation or require a different setup.
