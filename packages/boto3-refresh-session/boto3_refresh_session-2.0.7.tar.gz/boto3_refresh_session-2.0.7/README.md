## ⚠️ Important Update

I am currently grappling with a serious medical condition that negatively impacts my vision. Accordingly, development of the `iot` and `ec2` modules has been delayed. Expect delayed responses to issues and pull requests until my health stabilizes. 

Thank you for supporting this project. 

---

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for `boto3.session.Session`
- Supports automatic credential refresh methods for various AWS services:
  - STS
  - ECS
- Supports custom authentication methods for complicated authentication flows
- Natively supports all parameters supported by `boto3.session.Session`
- [Tested](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/boto3-refresh-session/tree/main/tests), [documented](https://michaelthomasletts.github.io/boto3-refresh-session/index.html), and [published to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-refresh-session/)
- Future releases will include support for IoT (coming soon), EC2, and SSO

## Recognition and Testimonials

[Featured in TL;DR Sec.](https://tldrsec.com/p/tldr-sec-282)

[Featured in CloudSecList.](https://cloudseclist.com/issues/issue-290)

Recognized during AWS Community Day Midwest on June 5th, 2025.

A testimonial from a Cyber Security Engineer at a FAANG company:

> _Most of my work is on tooling related to AWS security, so I'm pretty choosy about boto3 credentials-adjacent code. I often opt to just write this sort of thing myself so I at least know that I can reason about it. But I found boto3-refresh-session to be very clean and intuitive [...] We're using the RefreshableSession class as part of a client cache construct [...] We're using AWS Lambda to perform lots of operations across several regions in hundreds of accounts, over and over again, all day every day. And it turns out that there's a surprising amount of overhead to creating boto3 clients (mostly deserializing service definition json), so we can run MUCH more efficiently if we keep a cache of clients, all equipped with automatically refreshing sessions._

## Installation

```bash
pip install boto3-refresh-session
```

## Usage

<details>
  <summary><strong>STS (click to expand)</strong></summary>

  ### STS

  Most users use AWS STS to assume an IAM role and return a set of temporary security credentials. boto3-refresh-session can be used to ensure those temporary credentials refresh automatically. 

  ```python
  import boto3_refresh_session as brs

  # you can pass all of the params normally associated with boto3.session.Session
  profile_name = "<your-profile-name>"
  region_name = "us-east-1"
  ...

  # as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client.assume_role
  assume_role_kwargs = {
    "RoleArn": "<your-role-arn>",
    "RoleSessionName": "<your-role-session-name>",
    "DurationSeconds": "<your-selection>",
    ...
  }

  # as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client, except for 'service_name'
  sts_client_kwargs = {
    "region_name": region_name,
    ...
  }

  # basic initialization of boto3.session.Session
  session = brs.RefreshableSession(
    assume_role_kwargs=assume_role_kwargs, # required
    sts_client_kwargs=sts_client_kwargs,
    region_name=region_name,
    profile_name=profile_name,
    ...
  )
  ```

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>ECS (click to expand)</strong></summary>

  ### ECS

  You can use boto3-refresh-session in an ECS container to automatically refresh temporary security credentials.

  ```python
  session = RefreshableSession(
    method="ecs", 
    region_name=region_name, 
    profile_name=profile_name,
    ...
  )
  ```

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Custom authentication flows (click to expand)</strong></summary>

  ### Custom

  If you have a highly sophisticated, novel, or idiosyncratic authentication flow not included in boto3-refresh-session then you will need to provide your own custom temporary credentials callable object. `RefreshableSession` accepts custom credentials callable objects, as shown below.

  ```python
  # create (or import) your custom credential method
  def your_custom_credential_getter(...):
      ...
      return {
          "access_key": ...,
          "secret_key": ...,
          "token": ...,
          "expiry_time": ...,
      }

  # and pass it to RefreshableSession
  session = RefreshableSession(
      method="custom",
      custom_credentials_method=your_custom_credential_getter,
      custom_credentials_method_args=...,
      region_name=region_name,
      profile_name=profile_name,
      ...
  )
  ```
