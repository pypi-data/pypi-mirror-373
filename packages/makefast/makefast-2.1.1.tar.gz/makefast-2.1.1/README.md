## Database Configuration
Makefast provide the easiest way to configure the database and using them. By default makefast has 2 databases which is MySql and MongoDB.

### MySQL

To initiate MySQL, add below lines on `main.py` file as necessary.
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from makefast.database import MySQLDatabaseInit

app = FastAPI()

MySQLDatabaseInit.init(app)
```

### MongoDB

To initiate MongoDB, add below lines on `main.py` file as necessary.
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from makefast.database import MongoDBDatabaseInit

app = FastAPI()

MongoDBDatabaseInit.init(app)
```

### Database CRUD operations

Makefast offers default functions for CRUD operations. Before using these, you need to create a model that corresponds to the MySQL table or MongoDB collection.

#### Create
To create a new record, use the Model.create method, passing in the desired attributes. This method is asynchronous and returns a response that typically contains information about the newly created record.
```py
from app.models import User

create_response = await User.create(**{
    "username": "usertest",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "test123",
})
```
#### Update
To update an existing record, specify the ID and the fields to modify using Model.update. This example updates the name field of the user with ID 45.
```py
from app.models import User

await User.update(45, **{
    "name": "New name"
})
```
#### Find one
To retrieve a single record, use Model.find. This function typically returns the first record matching the criteria or, if no criteria are specified, an arbitrary record.
```py
from app.models import User

await User.find(45)
```
#### Find all
To retrieve all the records, use the Model.all method, which returns a collection of records.
```py
from app.models import User

await User.all()
```
#### Delete
To delete a record by their ID, use the Model.delete method. Here, we remove the user with an ID of 45.
```py
from app.models import User

await User.delete(45)
```
