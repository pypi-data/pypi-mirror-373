Total revenue reached $1.24 billion, marking an 8.4% year-over-year increase from $1.14 billion in Q2 2024. The semiconductor segment generated $780 million‚Äîup 10.1%‚Äîas sales of the new A7 microprocessor family accelerated, while the software and services division contributed $460 million, up 5.2%, on the strength of recurring cloud-based licensing revenues. Gross profit for the quarter was $520 million, yielding a gross margin of 41.9%, compared to $470 million and 41.2% margin in the year-ago period. Operating expenses totaled $310 million, comprising $130 million in research and development (10.5% of revenues) and $180 million in selling, general and administrative costs (14.5% of revenues). As a result, operating income improved to $210 million‚Äîan operating margin of 16.9%, up from $180 million and 15.8% last year. Net income attributable to shareholders was $165 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.7%; this compares favorably with net income of $142 million, or $0.70 per share, in Q2 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter was $185 million, after capital expenditures of $45 million. The balance sheet remains strong, with cash and short-term investments of $720 million against total debt of $340 million, resulting in a net cash position of $380 million. In view of these results, management is raising full-year revenue guidance to $4.90‚Äì$5.00 billion (previously $4.80‚Äì$4.95 billion) and narrowing adjusted earnings-per-share guidance to $3.35‚Äì$3.45 (from $3.30‚Äì$3.50), reflecting confidence in continued growth across both semiconductor and software channels. The Board of Directors also approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on July 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of June 30, 2025."
