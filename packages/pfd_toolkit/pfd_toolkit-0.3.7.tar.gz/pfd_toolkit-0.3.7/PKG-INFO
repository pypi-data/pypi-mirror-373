Turn raw PFD reports into structured insights â€” fast.

PFD Toolkit is a suite of tools that replaces the manual effort involved in the collection, screening, and thematic discovery of PFD reports. It helps researchers, journalists, and public health analysts turn raw reports into actionable insights.

For more information, please consult package [documentation](https://pfdtoolkit.org/).

## Getting started


### Installation


```bash
pip install pfd_toolkit
```


### Load PFD Report Data (in seconds)

To load PFD data, just import the module, specify the category of reports and your date-range:

```python
from pfd_toolkit import load_reports

reports = load_reports(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2025-05-01"
)
```

`reports` will be a pandas DataFrame. Each row is a separate report, and each column is a report section. For example:


| url                        | date       | coroner    | area                        | receiver                | investigation           | circumstances                 | concerns                   |

PFD Toolkit updates daily with freshly published reports. By default,
`load_reports()` fetches the latest data each time. To reuse a locally cached
copy for faster loading, set `refresh` to `False`:

```py
reports = load_reports(refresh=False)
```

### Key features

Beyond loading reports, PFD Toolkit lets you:
 * Screen reports: find cases relevant to your specific research question.
 * Summarise text: distill full-length reports into a custom summary.
 * Discover themes: uncover recurring topics contained within a selection of reports.
 * Categorise: assign and tabulate reports by discovered or user-defined themes.

To get started with these features, please check out the [documentation](https://pfdtoolkit.org/).
