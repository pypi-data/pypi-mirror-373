# The following workflow is used to verify the UV package build.
# It is triggered on push to the main branch and on pull requests.
# It checks out the pfd-toolkit repository, installs the UV package using the astral-sh/setup-uv action,
# sets up Python using the actions/setup-python action, and installs the pfd-toolkit package with all extras and dev dependencies.
