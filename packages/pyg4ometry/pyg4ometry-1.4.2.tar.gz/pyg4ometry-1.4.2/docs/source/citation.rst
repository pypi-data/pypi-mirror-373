Referencing & Citation
======================

.. important::

   Citation information can be obtained on GitHub by pointing your browser to
   `github.com/g4edge/pyg4ometry <https://github.com/g4edge/pyg4ometry>`_ and
   selecting "Cite this repository" in the sidebar on the right. pyg4ometry
   uses a `CITATION.cff
   <https://github.com/g4edge/pyg4ometry/blob/main/CITATION.cff>`_ file.

Citations allow the authors to demonstrably show the code usage and therefore to
continue to support the development and maintenance of pyg4ometry.

Any publications including simulations made using pyg4ometry **must** cite:

  S.D. Walker, A. Abramov, L.J. Nevay, W. Shields, S.T. Boogert,
  *"pyg4ometry: A Python library for the creation of Monte Carlo radiation transport physical geometries"*,
  Computer Physics Communications **272** 108228 (2022).
  DOI: `10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108228 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108228>`_

Additionally, we automatically generate a DOI for each pyg4ometry code release
through Zenodo at `this page
<https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10449301>`_, if you wish to cite a
specific pyg4ometry version.
