Building (Prerequisites)

  - Python 3 (tested with version 3.12.4)
  - Compiled NOMAD with static libraries (tested with version 4.4.0) 
  - GCC release that supports at least C++17 (tested with version 14.1.1)
  - Exported the NOMAD_PATH environment variable

Building (A minimal build of NOMAD)

  This is a considerably condensed version of the official installation guide
  adapted to the purpose of manually building this module.

  (Step 1) Download and extract the v4.4.0 release of NOMAD somewhere.

    wget https://github.com/bbopt/nomad/archive/refs/tags/v.4.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxf v.4.4.0.tar.gz

  (Step 2) Enter the nomad-v.4.4.0 directory

    cd nomad-v.4.4.0

  (Step 3) Export path to the current directory (needed for the final step)

    export NOMAD_PATH=$(pwd)

  (Step 3) Prepare and build the core NOMAD library.

    cmake -S . -B build \
      -DBUILD_INTERFACE_PYTHON=ON \
      -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
      -DTEST_OPENMP=OFF

    cmake --build build --config Release --clean-first --target nomadStatic --parallel

    Please note that you can set --parallel to the number of cores available. 

  (Step 5) Compile nomadlad module.
    
    Please note that NOMAD_PATH must be exported for this to work. 

    (Option A) Install directly from a tagged commit

      pip install --user --upgrade \
        git+https://github.com/jan-provaznik/nomadlad.git@v1.0.0

    (Option B) Build from a locally cloned repository. Enter the repository first.

      python -m pip wheel -w dist -- .

  (Step 6) Profit.
