# ----- PULSES -----
# Simulated pulses are instantaneous. Pulseq blocks containing pulse events are
# split in the center of the pulse shape and converted into a gradient event
# before the pulse and a pulse + gradient event afterwards. This should result
# in a simulation that has no e.g. slice selection, but where the gradeint
# moments seen by refocussed, excited and unaffected magnetisation are correct.
# ----- ADC -----
# As stated in the specification, all samples are placed at (n + 0.5) * raster,
# which means when there is a gradient and an adc sample at the same time,
# the adc measurement sees only the first half of the gradient. TODO: check
# pulseq exporters and the Siemens interpreter to see if they respect the spec
# or if the adc samples should rather be placed at (n + 0 or 1) * raster.
# ----- GRADIENTS -----
# Only TRAP gradients are currently supported, arbitrary gradients would
# require to resample the gradient onto the ADC time grid. Note that the spec
# does not specify what should happen in between gradient samples, but there
# are two sensible options:
#  - Mimic the scanner, where interpolation is given by the electronics, but a
#    simple linear or bezier or similar interpolation should be a good choice
#  - Adhere to the implementation of the official pulseq exporter, which
#    probably assumes a piecewise constant gradient
# NOTE: As long as we don't simulate diffusion, we don't care about the shape
# of a gradient if it is not measured simultaneously.
# ----- Additional -----
# Simultaneous RF and ADC events are not supported but probably don't exist in
# pracitce anyways.
