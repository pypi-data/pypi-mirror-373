Brainweb Tissues:
 - CSF
   T1: 4163 ± 263
	T2: 1650 (approx, taken from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973950/)
	T2*: 57.1 -> T2': 59.1

 - Gray Matter
   T1: 1558 ± 88
	T2: 83 ± 4
   T2*: 66.0 ± 1.4 -> T2': 322

 - White Matter
   T1: 830 ± 0
	T2: 75 ± 3
   T2*: 53.2 ± 1.2 -> T2': 183
	T2': 56 ± 1

 - Fat
   T1: 374 ± 45
	T2: 125
	T2* = 10.7 -> T2': 11.7

# The following values are not used for phantom generation

 - Muscle
   T1: 1100 ± 59
	T2: 40

 - Muscle/Skin

 - Skull
    Probably similar to Bone marrow, but they don't overlap in the images

 - Blood vessels
    Probably similar to CSF (mostly water)

 - Connective (region around fat)
    Overlaps nearly fully with Fat

 - Dura matter
    Very little volume, probably not noticable at lower resolutions

 - Bone marrow
    T1: 586 ± 73
	T2: 127


Diffusion:
Values taken from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.1076
10^-3 mm² / s
CSF: 3.19 ± 0.10
WM:  0.65 ± 0.03
GM:  0.83 ± 0.05

No great source for fat, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.24535
says it barely diffuses
FAT: ~0.1
