# ProvWorkflow

This is a Python library for creating workflows of "Blocks", components of "Workflows" that log their actions in RDF, 
according to the [Prov Workflow (ProvWF)](https://data.surroundaustralia.com/def/provworkflow) profile of the 
[PROV-O standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/).

A brief description of what provenance is, and the components used, reproduced from 
[PROV-DM: The PROV Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/):  

> _Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, 
which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. PROV-DM is the conceptual 
data model that forms a basis for the W3C provenance (PROV) family of specifications. PROV-DM distinguishes core 
structures, forming the essence of provenance information, from extended structures catering for more specific uses of 
provenance. PROV-DM is organized in six components, respectively dealing with: (1) entities and activities, and the time
 at which they were created, used, or ended; (2) derivations of entities from entities; (3) agents bearing
  responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a notion of bundle, a mechanism to
   support provenance of provenance; (5) properties to link entities that refer to the same thing; and, (6) collections
    forming a logical structure for its members._

To use this library, poetry is recommended, see [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). With Poetry installed, run `poetry add provworkflow` to add this library to your project.  
Alternatively, create a requirements.txt file with the items in the `pyproject.toml` file under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
