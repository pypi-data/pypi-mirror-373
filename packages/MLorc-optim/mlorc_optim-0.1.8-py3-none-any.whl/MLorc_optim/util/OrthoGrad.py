def _orthogonalize_gradient(p: Tensor, grad: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Projects the gradient `grad` to be orthogonal to the parameter `p`,
    and then re-scales the result to have the same norm as the original gradient.
    This method is based on the `OrthoGrad` optimizer from the paper
    "Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability" (Prieto et al., 2025):
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04697)
    It is intended to prevent Naïve Loss Minimization (NLM) by removing the component
    of the gradient that is parallel to the weight vector.
