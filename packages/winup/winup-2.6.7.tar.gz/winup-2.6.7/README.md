# WinUp 🚀

## Make sure to download the Latest Stable Release (LSR) and not the latest/LFR! Current LSR: 2.5.7

`pip install winup==2.5.7`

### For the old way which doesn't use component based platform rendering see [here](tests), for the new component based rendering way see [here](examples).

**A ridiculously Pythonic and powerful framework for building beautiful desktop applications.**

WinUp is a modern UI framework for Python that wraps the power of PySide6 (Qt) in a simple, declarative, and developer-friendly API. It's designed to let you build applications faster, write cleaner code, and enjoy the development process.

### ✨ Now with Web Support!
WinUp now also supports building fully interactive, stateful web applications using the same Python-centric, component-based approach. The web module uses FastAPI and WebSockets under the hood to bring the simplicity of WinUp to the browser.

[Web Documentation](docs/web/README.md)

> **Disclaimer:** Web support is an optional feature. To use it, you must install the web dependencies:
> ```bash
> pip install winup[web]
> ```

## Why WinUp? (Instead of raw PySide6 or Tkinter)

Desktop development in Python can feel clunky. WinUp was built to fix that.

| Feature                 | WinUp Way ✨                                                                   | Raw PySide6 / Tkinter Way 😟                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layouts**             | `ui.Column(children=[...])`, `ui.Row(children=[...])`                          | `QVBoxLayout()`, `QHBoxLayout()`, `layout.addWidget()`, `pack()`, `grid()`                  |
| **Styling**             | `props={"background-color": "blue", "font-size": "16px"}`                      | Manual QSS strings, `widget.setStyleSheet(...)`, complex style objects.                     |
| **State Management**    | `state.bind(widget, "prop", "key")`                                            | Manual callback functions, getters/setters, `StringVar()`, boilerplate everywhere.          |
| **Two-Way Binding**     | `state.bind_two_way(input_widget, "key")`                                      | Non-existent. Requires manual `on_change` handlers to update state and UI.                  |
| **Developer Tools**     | **Built-in Hot Reloading**, code profiler, and window tools out of the box.    | Non-existent. Restart the entire app for every single UI change.                            |
| **Code Structure**      | Reusable, self-contained components with `@component`.                         | Often leads to large, monolithic classes or procedural scripts.                             |

**In short, WinUp provides the "killer features" of modern web frameworks (like React or Vue) for the desktop, saving you time and letting you focus on what matters: your application's logic.**

## Core Features

*   **Declarative & Pythonic UI:** Build complex layouts with simple `Row` and `Column` objects instead of clunky box layouts.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Use the `@component` decorator to create modular and reusable UI widgets from simple functions.
*   **Powerful Styling System:** Style your widgets with simple Python dictionaries using `props`. Create global "CSS-like" classes with `style.add_style_dict`.
*   **Full Application Shell:** Build professional applications with a declarative API for `MenuBar`, `ToolBar`, `StatusBar`, and `SystemTrayIcon`.
*   **Asynchronous Task Runner:** Run long-running operations in the background without freezing your UI using the simple `@tasks.run` decorator.
*   **Performance by Default:** Includes an opt-in `@memo` decorator to cache component renders and prevent needless re-computation.
*   **Advanced Extensibility:**
    *   **Widget Factory:** Replace any default widget with your own custom implementation (e.g., C++ based) using `ui.register_widget()`.
    *   **Multiple Windows:** Create and manage multiple independent windows for complex applications like tool palettes or music players.
*   **Reactive State Management:**
    *   **One-Way Binding:** Automatically update your UI when your data changes with `state.bind()`.
    *   **Two-Way Binding:** Effortlessly sync input widgets with your state using `state.bind_two_way()`.
    *   **Subscriptions:** Trigger any function in response to state changes with `state.subscribe()`.
*   **Developer-Friendly Tooling:**
    *   **Hot Reloading:** See your UI changes instantly without restarting your app.
    *   **Profiler:** Easily measure the performance of any function with the `@profiler.measure()` decorator.
    *   **Window Tools:** Center, flash, or manage your application window with ease.
*   **Built-in Routing:** Easily create multi-page applications with an intuitive, state-driven router.
*   **Flexible Data Layer:** Includes simple, consistent connectors for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.
