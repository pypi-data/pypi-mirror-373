    """
    Implicit Euler solver for multi-compartment neurons using 
    Dendritic Hierarchical Scheduling (DHS).

    Purpose:
        Advance the membrane potential V by one timestep dt 
        with an implicit scheme tailored for tree-structured morphologies.

    Steps:
        1. Ensure branch-tree representation is available, and extract
           morphology metadata: diagonals, upper/lower off-diagonals,
           parent indices, internal node indices, and flipped edges.
        2. Extract the current membrane potential V and compute 
           linear and constant contributions from all ion channels and synapses.
        3. Reshape all vectors to consistent batch shape (P, Nseg) and 
           scatter values into full node arrays including boundary nodes.
        4. Assemble the implicit Euler system:
               - Scale diagonals, uppers, and lowers by dt.
               - Add unit diagonal to internal nodes to include I-term.
               - Construct the RHS vector for the linear system.
        5. Append a "virtual" or spurious node to improve numerical stability 
           and simplify boundary handling.
        6. Solve the linear system for all populations in parallel 
           using DHS forward elimination + back-substitution (via vmap).
        7. Extract internal node results and write them back to 
           target.V.value, preserving the original shape.

    """Backsubstitute with recursive doubling.

    This function contains a lot of math, so I will describe what is going on here:

    The matrix describes a system like:
    diag[n] * x[n] + lower[n] * x[parent] = solve[n]

    We rephrase this as:
    x[n] = solve[n]/diag[n] - lower[n]/diag[n] * x[parent].

    and we call variables as follows:
    solve/diag => solve_effect
    -lower/diag => lower_effect

    This gives:
    x[n] = solve_effect[n] + lower_effect[n] * x[parent].

    Recursive doubling solves this equation for `x` in log_2(N) steps. How?

    (1) Notice that lower_effect[n]=0, because x[0] has no parent.

    (2) In the first step, recursive doubling substitutes x[parent] into
    every equation. This leads to something like:
    x[n] = solve_effect[n] + lower_effect[n] * (solve_effect[parent] + ...
    ...lower_effect[parent] * x[parent[parent]])

    Abbreviate this as:
    new_solve_effect[n] = solve_effect[n] + lower_effect[n] * solve_effect[parent]
    new_lower_effect[n] = lower_effect[n] + lower_effect[parent]
    x[n] = new_solve_effect[n] + new_lower_effect[n] * x[parent[parent]]
    Importantly, every node n is now a function of its two-step parent.

    (3) In the next step, recursive doubling substitutes x[parent[parent]].
    Since x[parent[parent]] already depends on its own _two-step_ parent,
    every node then depends on its four step parent. This introduces the
    log_2 scaling.

    (4) The algorithm terminates when all `new_lower_effect=0`. This
    naturally happens because `lower_effect[0]=0`, and the recursion
    keeps multiplying new_lower_effect with the `lower_effect[parent]`.
    """

    # Why `lowers = lowers.at[0].set(0.0)`? During triangulation (and the
    # cpu-optimized solver), we never access `lowers[0]`. Its value should
    # be zero (because the zero-eth compartment does not have a `lower`), but
    # it is not for coding convenience in the other solvers. For the recursive
    # doubling solver below, we do use lowers[0], so we set it to the value
    # it should have anyways: 0.
    lowers = lowers.at[0].set(0.0 * u.get_unit(lowers))

    # Rephrase the equations as a recursion.
    # x[n] = solve[n]/diag[n] - lower[n]/diag[n] * x[parent].
    # x[n] = solve_effect[n] + lower_effect[n] * x[parent].
    lower_effect = -lowers / diags
    solve_effect = solves / diags

    step = 1
    while step <= steps:
        # For each node, get its k-step parent, where k=`step`.
        k_step_parent = u.math.arange(n_nodes + 1)

        lower_effect *= lower_effect[k_step_parent]

    # We have to return a `diags` because the final solution is computed as
    # `solves/diags` (see `step_voltage_implicit_with_dhs_solve`). For recursive
    # doubling, the solution should just be `solve_effect`, so we define diags as
    # 1.0 so the division has no effect.
