"""
This script attempts to create a valid SEL .rdb file by creating an Excel file
and then converting it to the RDB format.

However, this approach may not work because SEL RDB files have a specific
OLE2 structured storage format that may not be replicable by simply
creating an Excel file and renaming it.

This is a placeholder script that shows the concept. A proper implementation
would require using Windows COM objects or a library that can create
structured storage files.
