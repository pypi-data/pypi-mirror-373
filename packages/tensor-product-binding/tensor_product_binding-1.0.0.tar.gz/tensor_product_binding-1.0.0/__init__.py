"""
Tensor Product Variable Binding Library
Based on: Smolensky (1990) "Tensor Product Variable Binding and the Representation of Symbolic Structures"

This library implements the foundational method for representing structured knowledge 
in neural networks using tensor products to bind variables with values.
