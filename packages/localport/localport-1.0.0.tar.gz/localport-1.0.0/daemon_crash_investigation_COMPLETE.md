# Daemon Crash Investigation - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary
The LocalPort daemon was experiencing crashes that prevented services from staying up, despite the cluster being healthy. The user reported that the daemon was running but services were down and not being restarted.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps
1. **Checked daemon status**: Daemon was running but showed 0 active services
2. **Examined logs**: Found the daemon was crashing and restarting in a loop
3. **Identified the error**: JSON serialization error in shutdown coordinator

### The Bug
The issue was in `src/localport/infrastructure/shutdown/shutdown_coordinator.py` at lines 175-183:

```python
# Log final results
if self._shutdown_successful:
    logger.info("Graceful shutdown completed successfully", 
               duration=self._total_shutdown_time,
               phase_durations=self._phase_durations)  # ‚ùå BUG HERE
else:
    logger.error("Graceful shutdown failed", 
                duration=self._total_shutdown_time,
                failed_phase=self._current_phase.value if self._current_phase else "unknown",
                phase_durations=self._phase_durations)  # ‚ùå BUG HERE
```

**Error**: `TypeError: keys must be str, int, float, bool or None, not ShutdownPhase`

### Why This Happened
- The `self._phase_durations` dictionary uses `ShutdownPhase` enum values as keys
- When structlog tries to serialize this for JSON logging, it fails because JSON doesn't support enum keys
- This caused the daemon to crash during shutdown, then restart, creating a crash loop
- Services would start but then get killed when the daemon crashed again

## The Fix

### Code Changes
Fixed the logging statements to convert enum keys to string values:

```python
# Log final results
if self._shutdown_successful:
    logger.info("Graceful shutdown completed successfully", 
               duration=self._total_shutdown_time,
               phase_durations={k.value: v for k, v in self._phase_durations.items()})  # ‚úÖ FIXED
else:
    logger.error("Graceful shutdown failed", 
                duration=self._total_shutdown_time,
                failed_phase=self._current_phase.value if self._current_phase else "unknown",
                phase_durations={k.value: v for k, v in self._phase_durations.items()})  # ‚úÖ FIXED
```

### Additional Fixes
Also fixed import issues in `src/localport/cli/commands/daemon_commands.py`:
- Replaced missing `Progress` and `SpinnerColumn` imports with `EnhancedProgress`
- Updated `restart_daemon_command` and `reload_daemon_command` functions

## Verification

### Test Results
After applying the fix:

1. **Daemon restart**: ‚úÖ Successful
   ```
   LocalPort daemon restarted successfully (PID: 86879)
   ```

2. **Service status**: ‚úÖ All services running and healthy
   ```
   üìä Total: 4 | üü¢ Running: 4 | üíö Healthy: 4
   ```

3. **Daemon status**: ‚úÖ Stable with 4 active services
   ```
   Status: Running
   PID: 86879
   Active Services: 4
   ```

4. **Logs**: ‚úÖ Clean startup without crashes
   - No more JSON serialization errors
   - Proper daemon startup sequence
   - All services auto-started successfully

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- Daemon in crash loop
- Services unable to stay running
- 0 active services despite healthy cluster
- Continuous restart cycles

### After Fix
- Daemon stable and running
- All 4 services running and healthy
- Proper service restart behavior restored
- Clean logging without serialization errors

## Lessons Learned

1. **JSON Serialization**: Always ensure dictionary keys are JSON-serializable when logging
2. **Enum Handling**: Convert enum values to strings before JSON serialization
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Critical paths like shutdown logging must be robust
4. **Testing**: Shutdown scenarios need comprehensive testing to catch serialization issues

## Files Modified

1. `src/localport/infrastructure/shutdown/shutdown_coordinator.py`
   - Fixed JSON serialization of enum keys in logging statements

2. `src/localport/cli/commands/daemon_commands.py`
   - Fixed missing import issues in restart and reload commands
   - Replaced Progress with EnhancedProgress

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

The daemon crash issue has been completely resolved. The daemon is now stable, services are running properly, and the restart logic is functioning as expected.
