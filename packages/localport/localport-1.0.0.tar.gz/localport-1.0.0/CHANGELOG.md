## [Unreleased]

### ðŸŽ¯ Improved
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Replaced verbose technical error messages with concise, actionable feedback
  - SSH key not found errors now show safe paths (`~/.ssh/key.pem`) instead of full system paths
  - Added contextual information (service name, configuration source) to help users identify issues
  - Included actionable suggestions for common problems (e.g., "Ask your colleague to share the correct key file name")
  - Technical details still available via `--verbose` and `--debug` flags for developers
  - Particularly improves experience when sharing configuration files between team members

### ðŸ”§ Technical
- Added structured error classification system with `LocalPortError` base class
- Implemented `SSHKeyNotFoundError` with built-in path sanitization and context enrichment  
- Created `ErrorFormatter` with multiple verbosity levels (normal, verbose, debug)
- Updated domain validation to use structured exceptions instead of generic `ValueError`
- Enhanced infrastructure layer to preserve error context through the application stack
- Added comprehensive integration tests for error formatting behavior

## [0.3.8] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- **SSH Bastion Host Support**: Complete SSH bastion host/jump server functionality for accessing internal resources
  - New `remote_host` parameter in SSH connection configuration
  - Support for connecting through bastion hosts to reach RDS databases and other internal services
  - Automatic SSH tunnel generation with proper bastion host routing
  - Real-world tested with AWS RDS through EC2 bastion hosts

### Enhanced
- **SSH Tunneling**: Significantly improved SSH tunneling capabilities
  - Enhanced `ConnectionInfo` value object with `get_ssh_remote_host()` method
  - Updated SSH adapter to use configurable remote hosts instead of hardcoded localhost
  - Fixed YAML configuration repository to properly pass `remote_host` parameter
  - Clean CLI experience with professional terminal output

### Configuration
- **Bastion Host Configuration**: New configuration format for SSH bastion scenarios
  ```yaml
  - name: database-service
    technology: ssh
    local_port: 5433
    remote_port: 5432
    connection:
      host: bastion.example.com      # Bastion/jump host
      user: ec2-user
      key_file: ~/.ssh/key.pem
      port: 22
      remote_host: internal-db.rds.amazonaws.com  # Target host behind bastion
  ```

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing SSH configurations continue to work unchanged
- **Migration**: No configuration changes required for existing SSH services
- **Version Management**: Proper version progression from v0.3.7.3 to v0.3.8

### Technical
- **SSH Command Generation**: Proper SSH command generation for bastion host scenarios
  - Example: `ssh -N -L 5433:internal-db.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 -i ~/.ssh/key.pem user@bastion.example.com`
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for SSH connection scenarios
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real-world bastion host configurations

This release enables LocalPort users to easily access internal infrastructure through bastion hosts while maintaining the familiar LocalPort interface and experience. Perfect for accessing RDS databases, internal APIs, and other services behind corporate firewalls or in private subnets.
