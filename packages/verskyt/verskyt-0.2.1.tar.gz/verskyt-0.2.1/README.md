**Verskyt** (pronounced "ver-SKIT") is a Python library for Tversky Neural Networks (TNNs) built on three design principles: **Modularity**, **Introspection**, and **Extensibility**. Verskyt provides PyTorch-compatible TNN implementations alongside tools for model introspection, prototype analysis, and causal interventions.

## What are Tversky Neural Networks?

Tversky Neural Networks represent a novel paradigm in deep learning, introduced by Doumbouya et al. (2025). TNNs replace traditional linear transformations with **similarity-based computations** grounded in cognitive science, specifically Tversky's feature-based similarity theory. TNNs operate by projecting inputs into a learned feature space (Ω), where similarity to explicit prototypes (Π) is computed.

**Key TNN Properties:**
- **Psychologically Plausible**: Based on established cognitive models of human similarity perception
- **Asymmetric Similarity**: Can learn that "A is more similar to B than B is to A" (unlike standard neural networks)
- **Interpretable Representations**: Uses explicit prototypes and feature sets that can be directly examined
- **Non-linear Single Layer**: Can solve non-linearly separable problems (like XOR) with just one layer

## What Verskyt Provides

**Design Principles:**

**🔧 Modularity**: Clean, composable components that integrate with existing PyTorch workflows
**🔍 Introspection**: Tools for examining model internals, learned prototypes, and decision processes
**🚀 Extensibility**: Built for researchers to modify and develop novel TNN-based architectures

### 🧠 TNN Implementation

**PyTorch Integration:**
- **Drop-in Compatibility**: Replace `torch.nn.Linear` layers with `verskyt.TverskyProjectionLayer` in existing models
- **Full Parameter Control**: All TNN components (prototypes (Π), features (Ω), and asymmetry parameters (α, β)) are learnable and accessible
- **Full Specification**: All 6 intersection reduction methods and 2 difference methods from the original paper
- **Tested Implementation**: Passes mathematical correctness tests, including the XOR non-linearity benchmark

### 🔬 Research Tools

Verskyt includes research tools for TNN exploration and development:

**Model Introspection:**
- **Prototype Analysis**: Examine learned prototype vectors and their semantic meanings
- **Feature Bank Inspection**: Understand which features the model has discovered
- **Similarity Landscape Mapping**: Visualize how the model perceives relationships between concepts

**Visualization Suite:**
- **Prototype Space Visualization**: PCA and t-SNE plots of learned prototype distributions
- **Data Clustering Analysis**: See how input data clusters around different prototypes
- **Feature-Prototype Relationships**: Advanced analysis of internal similarity computations
- **Interactive Research Tools**: High-quality plots for papers and presentations

**Causal Intervention Framework:**
- **Prototype Surgery**: Directly edit model concepts and observe behavioral changes
- **Counterfactual Analysis**: Simulate "what if" scenarios by modifying internal representations
- **Concept Grafting**: Transfer learned concepts between different models

**Experimental Infrastructure:**
- **Benchmark Suites**: Testing against paper specifications
- **Reproducible Research**: Tools for systematic hyperparameter exploration and results validation

## Quick Start

Install from PyPI:
`pip install verskyt`

### Basic Usage: Drop-in Replacement

`verskyt` layers are designed as drop-in replacements for standard PyTorch layers.

```python
import torch
from verskyt.layers import TverskyProjectionLayer

# A TNN layer that can replace nn.Linear(in_features=128, out_features=10)
layer = TverskyProjectionLayer(
    in_features=128,      # Dimensionality of the input vector
    num_prototypes=10,    # Corresponds to output classes
    num_features=256,     # Dimensionality of the internal learned feature space (Ω)
)

# It works just like a standard PyTorch layer
x = torch.randn(32, 128)
output = layer(x)  # shape: [32, 10]
```

### Advanced Usage: Introspection & Intervention

Inspect and modify model internals using the intervention toolkit:

```python
from verskyt.interventions import InterventionManager

# Assume 'model' is a trained model with TverskyProjectionLayer
manager = InterventionManager(model)

# 1. Inspect the model's learned concepts
prototypes = manager.list_prototypes()
print(f"Inspecting {len(prototypes)} learned prototypes.")

# 2. Examine individual prototypes and features
proto_info = manager.get_prototype("layer_name", 0)
print(f"Prototype 0: shape={proto_info.shape}, norm={proto_info.norm:.3f}")

# 3. Permanently edit a prototype ("prototype surgery")
original_proto = manager.get_prototype("layer_name", 0)
modified_vector = original_proto.vector * 0.5  # Dampen the prototype
manager.modify_prototype("layer_name", 0, modified_vector)

# 4. Reset to original state when done
manager.reset_to_original()
```
