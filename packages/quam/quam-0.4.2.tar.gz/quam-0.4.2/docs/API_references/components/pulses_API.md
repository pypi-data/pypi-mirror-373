# QUAM Pulses API

Welcome to the QUAM Pulses API Documentation.
The QUAM Pulses module offers a versatile framework for creating and controlling pulse schemes essential for quantum operations. 
Information can be found in [QUAM Pulses Documentation](/components/pulses) in the User Guide.

This section provides detailed API references for various pulse types—ranging from simple waveforms to complex modulated pulses—tailored for precise quantum state manipulation and measurement. Explore the properties, methods, and examples to effectively integrate these pulse components into your quantum experiments.
