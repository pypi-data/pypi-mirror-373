```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowrithm-py.git
cd knowrithm-py
pip install -e .
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the Client

```python
from knowrithm.client import KnowrithmClient
from config.config import Config

# Initialize the client
config = Config(api_key="your_api_key_here")
client = KnowrithmClient(config)
```

### 2. Create an AI Agent

```python
from knowrithm.agent import Agent

# Create a new agent
agent = client.create_agent(
    name="Customer Support Bot",
    description="AI agent for customer support",
    personality="friendly and helpful"
)

print(f"Agent created with ID: {agent.id}")
```

### 3. Train Your Agent

```python
from services.document import DocumentService

# Upload training documents
document_service = DocumentService(client)

# Train with documents
training_files = [
    "path/to/faq.pdf",
    "path/to/user_manual.docx",
    "path/to/product_info.txt"
]

for file_path in training_files:
    document_service.upload_document(agent.id, file_path)

# Start training
agent.train()
print("Training started. This may take a few minutes...")
```

### 4. Test Your Agent

```python
# Test the agent
response = agent.chat("How can I reset my password?")
print(f"Agent: {response.message}")
```

### 5. Deploy to Website

```python
# Generate embed code for your website
embed_code = agent.get_embed_code(
    theme="light",
    position="bottom-right",
    welcome_message="Hi! How can I help you today?"
)

print("Add this code to your website:")
print(embed_code)
```

## 📚 Detailed Usage

### Managing Agents

```python
from knowrithm.agent import Agent
from models.agent import AgentModel

# List all agents
agents = client.list_agents()

# Get specific agent
agent = client.get_agent("agent_id")

# Update agent settings
agent.update(
    name="Updated Bot Name",
    personality="professional and concise",
    max_response_length=500
)

# Delete agent
agent.delete()
```

### Training with Different Data Types

```python
from services.document import DocumentService

document_service = DocumentService(client)

# Upload PDF documents
document_service.upload_pdf("agent_id", "manual.pdf")

# Upload text content directly
document_service.upload_text("agent_id", """
Q: What are your business hours?
A: We're open Monday-Friday 9AM-6PM EST.
""")

# Upload from URL
document_service.upload_from_url("agent_id", "https://example.com/faq")

# Bulk upload
document_service.bulk_upload("agent_id", [
    {"type": "pdf", "path": "doc1.pdf"},
    {"type": "text", "content": "Custom knowledge..."},
    {"type": "url", "url": "https://example.com/help"}
])
```

### Conversation Management

```python
from services.conversation import ConversationService

conversation_service = ConversationService(client)

# Start a new conversation
conversation = conversation_service.start_conversation(
    agent_id="your_agent_id",
    user_id="user_123"
)

# Send messages
response = conversation_service.send_message(
    conversation_id=conversation.id,
    message="Hello, I need help with billing"
)

# Get conversation history
history = conversation_service.get_history(conversation.id)

# End conversation
conversation_service.end_conversation(conversation.id)
```

### Advanced Features

from dataclass.response import ResponseConfig

# Configure response behavior
response_config = ResponseConfig(
    max_length=300,
    tone="professional",
    include_sources=True,
    fallback_message="I'm sorry, I don't have information about that."
)

agent.update_response_config(response_config)
```

#### Analytics and Monitoring

```python
from services.dashboard import DashboardService

dashboard = DashboardService(client)

# Get agent performance metrics
metrics = dashboard.get_agent_metrics("agent_id")
print(f"Total conversations: {metrics.total_conversations}")
print(f"Average satisfaction: {metrics.avg_satisfaction}")

# Get popular questions
popular_questions = dashboard.get_popular_questions("agent_id")

# Export conversation logs
logs = dashboard.export_conversations("agent_id", date_range="last_30_days")
```
