    Attributes:

        allocation_method (AllocationMethod | None, optional): An :ref:`allocation method <allocation method>` for the server. Defaults to :func:`naive_allocation` for the default lifetime of a server, defined in the config file under default_values_server > lifetime.
        usage_rate (ReplicableValue | None, optional): The usage rate of the server, between 0 and 1. Defaults to the value defined in the config file under default_values_server > usage_rate.
