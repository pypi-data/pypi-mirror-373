        capacity (ReplicableValue | None, optional): The `battery capacity <TODO : REPLACE WITH ONTOLOGY OF BATTERY CAPACITY>`_. If None, it will be estimated from :attr:`server_consumption` and :attr:`battery_duration`.
        server_consumption (ReplicableValue | None, optional): The consumption of the server. Defaults to None.
        battery_duration (ReplicableValue | str | None, optional): The battery's expected duration with a consumption of :attr:`server_consumption`. Defaults to the value in the config file under ``default_values_battery > duration``.

        allocation_method (AllocationMethod | None, optional): The :ref:`allocation method` used to attribute a part of the battery's embodied impacts to a specific job. Defaults to :func:`naive_allocation`, where the lifetime is the value in the config file under ``default_values_battery > lifetime``.
