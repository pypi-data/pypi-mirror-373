## ZIPIP

A Python package installer that feels just like pip, but is built for speed.

## Why Zipip?

I got tired of waiting for big packages like PyTorch or TensorFlow to download one by one.

Zipip's main goal is to make installations faster. It does this by using parallel downloads to fetch a package utilizing multiple threads. This can seriously cut down on the time you spend waiting for your environment to be ready.

It handles dependency resolution and finds the right wheels for your system, so you can trust it to set up your projects correctly, just faster.

## Installation

pip install zipip

## Usage

In your commands, just replace pip with zipip :p
