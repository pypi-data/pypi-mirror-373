    Result:
    In the context of AQA (Automated Quality Assurance) backlog estimation, the sizes are defined as follows:
    
    
    S (Small): Estimated at 1 hour per test case.
    M (Medium): Estimated at 3 hours per test case.
    L (Large): Estimated at 5 hours per test case.
    
    Here's the approximate estimation for the overall test cases:
    Approximately 71 test cases are of size S, totaling 110 man-hours.
    Approximately 140 test cases are of size M, totaling 520 man-hours.
    Approximately 7 test cases are of size L, totaling 40 man-hours.
    
    The prioritization starts with Critical or Major test cases, skipping the Minor ones:
    
    About 110 Major test cases which include:
    
    20 test cases of size S, totaling 20 hours.
    75 test cases of size M, totaling 225 hours.
    5 test cases of size L, totaling 25 hours.
    
    Critical test cases should already be covered with automation.
