## About Family AI CLI

FamilyCLI brings AI-powered family members to life in your command line. Chat with loving personas like Grandma Rose, Uncle Joe, Dad Mike, and more - each with unique personalities, memories, and caring responses designed for children and families.

## ✨ Features

- 💭 **Conversation Memory** - Personas remember and reference previous messages
- 🛡️ **Child-Safe Responses** - Carefully engineered prompts for appropriate, caring interactions
- 🔐 **Secure API Storage** - Encrypted API key management in `~/.familyai`
- 🔄 **Multi-Provider Support** - Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cerebras, Google
- 📱 **WhatsApp-like Interface** - Familiar chat experience with recent conversations
- 🎨 **Rich UI** - Beautiful terminal interface with markdown support
- ⚡ **Retry & Fallback** - Robust error handling and graceful degradation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install familycli
```

#### Option 2: Install from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AIMLDev726/ai-family-cli.git
cd ai-family-cli

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### First Run

```bash
# Start the Family AI CLI
familycli

# Or if installed from source
python -m src.main
```

### Setup API Keys

1. Choose option `4` (Settings & Management)
2. Select `API Key Management`
3. Add keys for your preferred providers (Groq recommended for speed)

## 📋 CLI Commands

```bash
# Main command
familycli                    # Start the family chat interface

# Alternative (if installed from source)
python -m src.main          # Direct module execution
```

### Usage
1. Initialize the database:
   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```
2. Register a user and login via CLI prompts.
3. Create personas, start chat sessions, and interact with AI family members.


## Configuration Management
- All configuration is managed via JSON files in the `config/` directory and can be overridden by environment variables.
- Use `src/config/config_manager.py` to load, get, and reload config at runtime.
- Example:
  ```python
  from src.config.config_manager import ConfigManager
  config = ConfigManager().load('llm_providers')
  value = ConfigManager().get('llm_providers', 'default_provider')
  ConfigManager().reload('llm_providers')
  ```
- Environment variable override: set `LLM_PROVIDERS_OPENAI_API_KEY` to override OpenAI key in config.
## Performance Optimization
- Database uses connection pooling and batch commit for high throughput.
- LLM responses are cached (LRU) and API usage is tracked for cost management.
## Error Handling
- All critical operations have robust error handling and failover logic.
- LLM manager supports rate limit handling and provider failover.
- Streaming and chat modules recover from deadlocks and interruptions.
## Runtime Reload
- You can reload configuration at runtime using the `reload` method in `ConfigManager` and `UniversalLLMManager`.

  ```sh
  pytest
  ```

## Extending
