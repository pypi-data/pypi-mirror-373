    """Collect typed merge conflict cases.

    Reads the raw unmerged index (``git ls-files -u``) and groups index stages
    (1=base, 2=ours, 3=theirs) into logical "conflict families". Each family
    is normalised into one of the dataclass variants from
    :mod:`conflict_collection.schema.typed_five_tuple`.

    Skips files that Git internally marks as conflicted but whose working tree
    contents no longer contain conflict markers (auto-resolved edge cases).

    Args:
        repo_path: Filesystem path to a Git repository currently in a merge-conflict state.
        resolution_sha: Commit SHA representing the resolved state (used to retrieve final blob content).
        merge_config: Optional merge metadata (used to validate marker size / style).

    Returns:
        List of typed ``ConflictCase`` instances.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If expected blobs/paths are missing for a detected conflict shape.
