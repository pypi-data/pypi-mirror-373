    This class provides a centralized way to create and manage owner instances.
    It uses a global cache to ensure that the same owner (identified by platform and name)
    always returns the same instance, which is crucial for maintaining state and memory efficiency.

    The primary way to use the factory is through configurations:
    1. Register owner classes for platforms
    2. Register configurations
    3. Get owners using configurations

    Example:
        >>> platform = Platform(identifier="binance")
        >>> OwnerFactory.register_owner_class(platform, Account)
        >>> config = AccountConfiguration(identifier=AccountIdentifier(...))
        >>> OwnerFactory.register_configuration(config)
        >>> owner1 = OwnerFactory.get(config.identifier)
        >>> owner2 = OwnerFactory.get(config.identifier)
