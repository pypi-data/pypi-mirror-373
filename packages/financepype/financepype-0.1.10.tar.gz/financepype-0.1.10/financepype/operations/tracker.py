class OperationTracker:
    """Tracks and manages the lifecycle of trading operations.

    This class provides utilities for tracking in-flight operations, caching completed
    operations, and handling operation errors. It maintains different states for
    operations and provides methods to update and query their status.

    The tracker maintains three sets of operations:
    1. Active operations: Currently in-flight and being tracked
    2. Cached operations: Recently completed operations kept for a short time
    3. Lost operations: Operations that failed or couldn't be found

    Attributes:
        MAX_CACHE_SIZE (int): Maximum number of cached operations
        CACHED_OPERATION_TTL (float): Time to live for cached operations in seconds

    Example:
        >>> tracker = OperationTracker(event_publishers=[publisher])
        >>> tracker.start_tracking_operation(operation)
        >>> tracker.update_operator_operation_id("client_id_1", "exchange_id_1")
