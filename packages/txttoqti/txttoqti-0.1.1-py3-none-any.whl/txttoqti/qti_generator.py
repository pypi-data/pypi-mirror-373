"""
qti_generator.py: This module defines the QTIGenerator class, which is responsible for generating QTI-compliant XML from parsed questions.

The QTIGenerator class provides methods to create the necessary XML structure required for QTI packages, ensuring that the output is compatible with various learning management systems.

Main Features:
- Generate QTI XML from parsed questions
- Support for different question types
- Validation of generated XML structure

Example Usage:
    >>> from txttoqti.qti_generator import QTIGenerator
    >>> generator = QTIGenerator()
    >>> xml_output = generator.generate_qti_xml(parsed_questions)
    >>> print(xml_output)
