# <body>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat: A new feature
# * fix: A bug fix
# * docs: Documentation only changes
# * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf: A code change that improves performance
# * test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# * build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# * ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# * chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# * revert: Reverts a previous commit

# Scope is optional and should be the name of the package affected
# (as perceived by the person reading the changelog)

# Subject line should:
# * use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# * not capitalize the first letter
# * not end with a dot (.)

# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior

# Footer should contain:
# * Information about Breaking Changes
# * Reference GitHub issues that this commit closes

# Examples:
# feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays
# fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js
# docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
# fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js
# feat(lang): add polish language
# perf(core): improve bundle size by removing debug code
# BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.
