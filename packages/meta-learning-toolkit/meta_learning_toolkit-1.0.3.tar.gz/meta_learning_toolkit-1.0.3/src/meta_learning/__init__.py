Meta-Learning: Advanced Algorithms for Learning-to-Learn
=======================================================

This package implements cutting-edge meta-learning algorithms including:
- Test-Time Compute Scaling (2024 breakthrough)
- Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and variants
- Few-Shot Learning architectures
- Continual and Online Meta-Learning
- Multi-Modal Meta-Learning

Based on comprehensive research analysis of 30+ foundational papers
spanning 1987-2025, implementing the most impactful missing algorithms
from the current library ecosystem.

🔬 Research Foundation:
- Test-Time Compute Scaling (breakthrough 2024 algorithm)
- Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Finn et al., 2017)
- Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017)
- Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2016)
- Relation Networks (Sung et al., 2018)
- Online Meta-Learning (Finn et al., 2019)

🎯 Key Features:
- First public implementation of Test-Time Compute Scaling
- Advanced MAML variants including MAML-en-LLM for large language models
- Enhanced Few-Shot Learning with multi-scale features
- Continual Meta-Learning with experience replay
- Research-accurate implementations of foundational algorithms
