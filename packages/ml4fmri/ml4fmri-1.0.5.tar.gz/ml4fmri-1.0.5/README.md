# ml4fmri

A **one-line Python toolkit** for fMRI classification that allows you to benchmark multiple deep learning models for fMRI analysis on your data with a single function call. While designed for fMRI time series, it can work with any temporal classification task.

Originally based on the codebase behind the NeuroImage paper ["A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for fMRI time-series classification"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120909)

## Use example

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ml4fmri
```

Check out the 👉 [**Colab tutorial**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-WtiB3ne4dkiOg8lt7MyzDYADMnE1lTv?usp=sharing) for a more detailed guide and ways to modify the default behavior.


```python
# In Python, get fMRI time series DATA in shape (SAMPLES, TIME, FEATURES)
# and LABELS in shape (SAMPLES) (binary or multiclass)

from ml4fmri import cvbench  # runs CV experiments with implemented models on the given data

# Run cross-validation with all available models. See below for more info on available `models`
report = cvbench(DATA, LABELS, models='all', n_folds=5)

# Plot test AUC boxplots for all models
report.plot_scores()

# Save test and training dataframes as .csv, and metadata as .json
report.save()

# Access logs directly as variables
train_df = report.get_train_dataframe()
test_df  = report.get_test_dataframe()
meta     = report.get_meta()

# Inspect training curves
report.plot_training_curves()
```


## Available Models
You can set `models` input in `cvbench` to:
- **'all'** - (default for non-CPU) run all models,
- **'lite'** (default for CPU) – use only faster models, better for quick tests  
- **'ts'** – run only time series models  
- **'fnc'** – run only FNC models; FNC data is derived from input time series  
- **'<model_name>'** – run only the specified model (e.g. 'meanMLP'); see below for full model list  
- **['<model_name_1>', '<model_name_2>']** – run only the listed models
