## Installation

```bash
pip install allora_sdk
```

## ML Inference Worker

Submits predictions to Allora Network topics with your ML models. The worker handles wallet creation, blockchain transactions, and automatic retries so that you can focus on model engineering.

### Quick Start

The simplest way to start participating in the Allora network is to paste the following snippet into a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook (or just a Python file that you can run from your terminal).  It will automatically handle all of the network onboarding and configuration behind the scenes, and will start submitting inferences automatically.

**NOTE:** you will need an Allora API key.  You can obtain one for free at [https://developer.allora.network](https://developer.allora.network)

```python
from allora_sdk.worker import AlloraWorker
import asyncio

def my_model():
    # Your ML model prediction logic
    return 120000.0  # Example BTC price prediction

async def main():
    worker = AlloraWorker(
        predict_fn=my_model,
        api_key="<YOUR API KEY HERE>",
    )
    
    async for result in worker.run():
        if isinstance(result, Exception):
            print(f"Error: {result}")
        else:
            print(f"Prediction submitted: {result.prediction}")

# IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN A PYTHON FILE:
asyncio.run(main())

# IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN A NOTEBOOK:
await main()
```

When you run this snippet, a few things happen:
- It configures this worker to communicate with our "testnet" network -- a place where no real funds are exchanged.
- It automatically generates an identity on the platform for you, represented by an `allo` address.
- It obtains a small amount of ALLO, the compute gas currency of the platform.
- It registers your worker to start submitting inferences to [Allora's "sandbox" topic](https://explorer.allora.network/topics/69) -- a topic for newcomers to figure out their configuration and setup, and to become accustomed to how things work on the platform. **There are no penalties for submitting poor inferences to this topic.**

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from allora_sdk.worker import AlloraWorker
from allora_sdk.rpc_client.tx_manager import FeeTier

worker = AlloraWorker(
    topic_id=1,
    predict_fn=my_model,

    #
    # These parameters give you the freedom to manage your identity on the platform as you prefer
    #
    mnemonic_file="./my_key",      # Custom mnemonic file location. Default is `./allora_key`.
    mnemonic="foo bar baz ...",    # Mnemonic phrase if you prefer to specify it directly.
    private_key="b381fa9cc20d...", # Hex-encoded 32-byte private key string.
    api_key="UP-...",              # Allora API key -- see https://developer.allora.network for a free key.

    # `fee_tier` controls how much you pay to ensure your inferences are included within an epoch.  The options are ECO, STANDARD, or PRIORITY -- default is STANDARD.
    fee_tier=FeeTier.PRIORITY,     # 

    # `debug` enables debug logging -- noisy, but good for debugging.
    debug=True,
)
```

## RPC Client

Low-level blockchain client for advanced users. Supports queries, transactions, and WebSocket subscriptions.

### Basic Usage

```python
from allora_sdk import LocalWallet, PrivateKey
from allora_sdk.rpc_client import AlloraRPCClient
from allora_sdk.protos.emissions.v9 import GetActiveTopicsAtBlockRequest, EventNetworkLossSet

# Initialize client
client = AlloraRPCClient.testnet(
    # mnemonic / private key are optional, only needed for sending transactions
    mnemonic=mnemonic,
)

# Query network data
topics = client.emissions.query.get_active_topics_at_block(
    emissions.GetActiveTopicsAtBlockRequest(block_height=1000)
)

# Submit transactions  
response = await client.emissions.tx.insert_worker_payload(
    topic_id=1,
    inference_value="55000.0",
    nonce=12345
)

# WebSocket subscriptions
async def handle_event(event, block_height):
    print(f"New epoch: {event.topic_id} at block {block_height}")

subscription_id = await client.events.subscribe_new_block_events_typed(
    emissions.EventNetworkLossSet,
    [ EventAttributeCondition("topic_id", "=", "1") ],
    handle_event
)
```

### Capabilities

RPC endpoint types:
- **gRPC API**: All emissions, bank, and staking operations
- **Cosmos-LCD REST API**: Same as above with identical interfaces

Determined by the RPC url string passed to the config constructor.  `grpc+http(s)` will utilize the gRPC Protobuf client, whereas `rest+http(s)` will use Cosmos-LCD.

- **Transaction support**: Fee estimation, signing, and broadcasting  
- **WebSocket events**: Real-time blockchain event subscriptions.  For a usage example, see the `AlloraWorker`
- **Multi-chain**: Testnet and mainnet support come with batteries included, but there is maximal configurability.  Can be used with other Cosmos SDK chains.
- **Type safety**: Full protobuf type and service definitions, codegen clients

## API Client

Slim, high-level HTTP client for querying a list of all topics, individual topic metadata, and network inference results.

**NOTE:** you will need an Allora API key.  You can obtain one for free at [https://developer.allora.network](https://developer.allora.network)

### Basic Usage

```python
from allora_sdk.api_client import AlloraAPIClient, ChainID

client = AlloraAPIClient(
    chain_id=ChainID.TESTNET,
    api_key="<YOUR API KEY HERE>",
)

# Get all active topics
topics = await client.get_all_topics()
print(f"Found {len(topics)} topics")

# Get latest inference
inference = await client.get_inference_by_topic_id(1)
print(f"BTC price: ${inference.inference_data.network_inference}")
```

### Features

- **Price predictions**: BTC, ETH, SOL, etc. across multiple timeframes
- **Topic discovery**: Browse all network topics and their metadata  
- **Confidence intervals**: Access prediction uncertainty bounds
- **Async/await**: Fully asynchronous API

## Development

This project uses modern Python tooling for development and supports Python 3.10-3.13.

### Prerequisites

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or use pip:

```bash
# Install uv (recommended)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or use pip
pip install uv
```

### Setup for development

The Makefile handles all development setup.  Simply run:

```bash
make dev
```

### Testing

The project uses tox for testing across Python versions:

```bash
# Run all tests across supported Python versions using `tox`
make test

# Test specific Python version
tox -e py312
```

### Code Generation

The SDK uses two code generation systems:

**Protobuf Generation (betterproto2):**
- Generates async Python clients from .proto files
- Sources: Cosmos SDK, Allora Chain, googleapis
- Output: `src/allora_sdk/protos/`
- Command: `make proto`

**REST Client Generation (custom):**
- Analyzes protobuf HTTP annotations to generate REST clients  
- Matches gRPC client interfaces exactly
- Sources: Same .proto files as above
- Output: `src/allora_sdk/rest/`
- Command: `make generate_rest_clients`

Both generators run automatically with `make dev`.

### Workflow

```bash
# Initial setup
make dev

# After changes to .proto files
make proto generate_rest_clients

# Run tests  
tox

# Build wheel for distribution
make wheel      # or: uv build
```

### Dependencies

- **Runtime dependencies**: Defined in `pyproject.toml` under `dependencies`
- **Development dependencies**: Under `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`  
- **Code generation**: Under `[project.optional-dependencies.codegen]`

The project pins specific versions of crypto dependencies (cosmpy, betterproto2) while allowing flexibility for general-purpose libraries.
