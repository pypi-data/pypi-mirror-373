{"name":"function_selection_appropriateness","jsonschema":{"title":"function_selection_appropriateness","description":"GROUNDING REQUIREMENT: You must evaluate whether this function call correctly implements the user's immediate request as the appropriate next step in the conversation. Base your assessment EXCLUSIVELY on the provided conversation history and available tool specifications. DO NOT hallucinate capabilities, tools, or context information that isn't explicitly present in these materials.\n\nCONTEXT UNDERSTANDING:\n- Use ONLY the provided conversation history (system prompt instructions, user requests, assistant messages, prior tool calls and their outputs) for context.\n- A conversation consists of alternating user and assistant turns. Each assistant turn may include multiple tool calls.\n- Tool calls may be independent (occurring simultaneously) OR chained (where each depends on previous calls).\n- For chained tool calls, consider the sequence. For independent calls, their order is not significant.\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- Compare this function against ALL functions in the provided tool inventory - do not reference or assume any tools not explicitly listed.\n- Judge only this specific tool call, not the entire solution to the user's overall intent.\n- Evaluate whether skipping this call would block meaningful progress toward the user's goal.\n- Check if the function's purpose directly addresses the user's explicit or implicit request.\n- A function call is redundant if: 1) it duplicates previous calls, 2) provides no new information, or 3) doesn't advance the user's goal.\n- Consider implicit requirements from earlier dialogue (e.g., \"only unread emails\" implies a filter flag).\n- This call can validly run alongside other tool calls without reducing its correctness.\n\nALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT:\n- If this function is inappropriate, determine if another function from the inventory would better serve the user's request.\n- If no suitable function exists in the inventory, indicate this explicitly.\n- Multiple functions may be valid matches - if this function addresses the relevant part of the user request, it is an appropriate selection.\n\nGROUNDING GUIDELINES:\n- Base your assessment ENTIRELY on the provided tool specifications and conversation history.\n- DO NOT assume capabilities or limitations beyond what's explicitly documented.\n- DO NOT reference functions, parameters, or features not listed in the tool inventory.\n- DO NOT speculate about underlying implementations or capabilities not mentioned in the specifications.\n- DO NOT hallucinate user intent that isn't supported by the conversation history.\n- Your evaluation MUST be factually grounded - flag a function as inappropriate ONLY when there is clear evidence it doesn't match the user's request.\n- Cite specific evidence from the provided materials in your assessment.","type":"object","properties":{"explanation":{"type":"string","description":"Provide a sentence or two explaining why this call does or does not align with the user's request as the correct next step in the conversation.
