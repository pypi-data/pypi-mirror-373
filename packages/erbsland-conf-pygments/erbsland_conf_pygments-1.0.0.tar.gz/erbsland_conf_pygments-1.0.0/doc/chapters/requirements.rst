Runtime Requirements
====================

To use the pygments lexer, you only need **Python 3.12 or newer**, the ``pygments`` and ``erbsland-conf`` package. You find these dependencies in the ``requirements.txt`` file.

Development Requirements
========================

If you want to develop, build, or test the parser, all required dependencies are listed in the ``requirements-dev.txt`` file.

You can install them with:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
