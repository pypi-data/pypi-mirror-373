# Janus Python SDK Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for the Janus Python SDK - a comprehensive AI agent testing and evaluation framework.

## What is Janus?

Janus Python SDK helps you build, test, and evaluate AI applications through automated conversations, function call tracing, and rule-based evaluation. It's designed to stress-test your AI agents with thousands of conversations, each simulating different personalities, intents, and edge cases.

## Key Features

- **Automated Testing**: Run multiple conversation simulations with different personas
- **Function Tracing**: Track every function call and tool usage automatically
- **Performance Evaluation**: Enforce domain-specific rules and monitor custom KPIs
- **Hallucination Detection**: Validate agent responses against your knowledge base
- **Framework Integration**: Works seamlessly with popular frameworks like LangChain

## Quick Start

1. **Install the SDK**:
   ```bash
   pip install janus-python-sdk
