This layer of submodules provides the application interfaces for various use cases.
Some of them are intended to provide a compatibility layer for the existing libraries for other languages and programming systems.

The classes implemented here will look like DataModules in pytorch lightning; they provide an all-in-one interface to the functionalities, and they are meant to be portable to an extent.
