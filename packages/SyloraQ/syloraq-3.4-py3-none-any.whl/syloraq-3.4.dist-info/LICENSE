1.2 **“Licensee” / “You”**  
The individual or legal entity granted rights under this Agreement.

1.3 **“Private Use”**  
Use strictly within Licensee’s organization by employees or contractors authorized under confidentiality obligations, on devices and infrastructure controlled by Licensee. Private Use excludes any third-party distribution, remote public access, or exposure to external users.

1.4 **“Public Use”**  
Any use that exposes the Software to third parties — including distribution, embedding into public products or services, cloud hosting, container images, API endpoints, repositories, or any publicly accessible system.

1.5 **“Modification”**  
Any alteration, adaptation, translation, patching, compilation, obfuscation, reverse-engineering, decompilation, disassembly, or other change to the Software, and any creation of Derivative Works by any means (including manual, automated, or AI-assisted methods).

1.6 **“Derivative Work” / “Derivative Program”**  
Any work that incorporates or is based upon the Software in whole or in part, including subsequent programs, libraries, modules, services, or outputs that depend upon, are generated from, or are built using the Software or any Derivative Program at any depth of derivation.

1.7 **“Immediate Creator” / “Immediate User”**  
The natural person or legal entity that directly produced, deployed, or distributed a Program or Derivative Program.

1.8 **“Malicious Use”**  
Any use that is intended to or reasonably expected to: (a) damage, disrupt, or compromise systems, networks, data, services, or devices; (b) create malware, ransomware, spyware, exploits, botnets, or similar harmful software; (c) facilitate unauthorized access to systems or data; (d) facilitate fraud, phishing, harassment, or invasion of privacy; or (e) otherwise violate applicable law or accepted security practices.

1.9 **“Protected Chain”**  
The hierarchical tree of Derivative Programs originating from SyloraQ Software where each layer propagates protective and restrictive obligations downstream and receives conditional liability protection upstream.

---

3.1 **Personal & Internal Use.** Use for personal, educational, research, development, testing, and internal business purposes is permitted so long as Licensee enforces the obligations and propagation requirements set forth in Section 11.

3.2 **Commercial & Public Use.** Public or commercial deployment is permitted only when Licensee: (a) includes required attribution (Section 6); (b) attaches the full license to distributed artifacts; (c) enforces Malicious Use prohibitions on all downstream users; and (d) complies with Third-Party Dependencies (Section 5) and Export Controls (Section 14).

3.3 **Cloud / Container / SaaS / AI Use.** Use in cloud, containerized, hosted, or AI-assisted environments is permitted under the same obligations. Licensee is responsible for access control, security, attribution, and license propagation for hosted endpoints and images.

---

## 4. PROHIBITIONS

4.1 **No Unauthorized Modification.** Licensee shall not modify, adapt, or create Derivative Works of the Software except as expressly permitted in writing by SyloraQ or as expressly allowed by law (and only for interoperability if legally required). Any permitted Modification must still comply with propagation and anti-malware rules.

4.2 **No Reverse Engineering for Circumvention.** Reverse-engineering, decompilation, disassembly, or other attempts to discover or bypass licensing, security, or attribution mechanisms are prohibited. Reverse-engineering allowed by mandatory law must not be used to evade any license obligation.

4.3 **No Malicious Use.** Use of the Software to create, test, distribute, or facilitate malware, ransomware, exploits, automated attacks, or other Malicious Use is strictly prohibited. **Any Program or Derivative Program that is used to create or distribute malicious software immediately loses all protections under this Agreement (see Section 10).**

4.4 **No Unauthorized Redistribution.** Licensee may not sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the Software as a standalone product except under terms that fully propagate this Agreement and achieve chain protection as defined in Section 11.

4.5 **No Circumvention.** Hiding, obfuscating, or otherwise attempting to evade any obligation of this Agreement (including attribution, propagation, auditing, or conditional protection) is prohibited.

4.6 **No Use to Violate Law.** The Software shall not be used to commit unlawful acts or to assist others in doing so.

---

## 5. THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES

5.1 **Acknowledgement & Compliance.** The Software may include or rely upon third-party components subject to separate licenses. Licensee must comply with those terms. Noncompliance constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

5.2 **Notice Requirement.** When distributing Derivative Programs, Licensee must include or reference all applicable third-party license notices and attributions required by those components.

---

## 6. ATTRIBUTION & TRADEMARK

6.1 **Attribution Required.** For any Public Use or distribution, Licensee must include the following attribution in a prominent place (e.g., UI footer, About page, product documentation, or README):  
> “This product uses software developed by SyloraQ © 2025.”

6.2 **Trademark Use.** Use of the SyloraQ® name or logo is permitted only to accurately identify origin and must not imply endorsement. Any use suggesting endorsement requires prior written permission and compliance with SyloraQ’s trademark guidelines.

6.3 **Propagation of Attribution.** Attribution must propagate with any distributed Derivative Program and be included in any End-User License Agreement (EULA) or terms presented to downstream users.

---

## 7. WARRANTY, TITLE & RISK

7.1 **As-Is.** The Software is provided “as is,” “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

7.2 **Title.** SyloraQ represents that it has the rights necessary to license the Software.

7.3 **User Responsibility.** Licensee is solely responsible for determining suitability of the Software for Licensee’s purposes and for compliance with applicable law.

7.4 **Data Protection.** If the Software processes personal data, Licensee is responsible for compliance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and for obtaining any necessary consents or legal bases.

7.5 **No Monitoring.** SyloraQ does not undertake proactive monitoring of Licensee’s use. Malicious acts or misuse are the sole responsibility of the Immediate Creator(s) as provided in Sections 9–11.

---

## 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

8.1 **Cap on Liability.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, SyloraQ’s total aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed USD $0. Where applicable law prohibits full exclusion of liability, the minimum liability permitted by such law applies.

8.2 **Excluded Damages.** In no event shall SyloraQ be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits, loss of business, or loss of data.

8.3 **Third-Party & Downstream Harm.** SyloraQ is not liable for any harm caused by Derivative Programs or by actions of downstream users.

---

## 9. INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 **By Licensee.** Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold SyloraQ and its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from:  
  a. Licensee’s use, distribution, or deployment of the Software or any Derivative Program;  
  b. Any breach by Licensee of this Agreement (including failure to propagate and enforce Sections 3–6 and 11);  
  c. Any Malicious Use by Licensee or by any downstream user of Licensee’s Derivative Program.

9.2 **Chain Indemnity.** Each Immediate Creator of a Derivative Program agrees to indemnify upstream authors and SyloraQ for claims arising from actions of their downstream users where the downstream actions arise from the Immediate Creator’s violation or failure to enforce the license obligations.

---

## 10. TERMINATION & CONDITIONAL PROTECTION REVOCATION

10.1 **Automatic Termination for Breach.** Licensee’s rights terminate automatically upon any material breach of this Agreement (including Malicious Use). Termination does not affect any accrued rights or obligations.

10.2 **Conditional Protection Revocation.** If any Program or Derivative Program is used, directly or indirectly, to create or distribute malicious software or otherwise engage in Malicious Use:  
  a. That Program and its Immediate Creator(s) lose all protections granted by this Agreement immediately;  
  b. All downstream Derivative Programs that are derived from the violating Program (at any depth) also lose protection automatically;  
  c. Any distribution, hosting, or sale of such violating Programs or their derivatives is a material breach and subjects the Immediate Creator to legal and equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and damages.

10.3 **Notice & Cure.** For non-Malicious breaches, SyloraQ may deliver written notice specifying the breach and a reasonable cure period (if feasible). For Malicious Use, no cure period is required and protection revocation is immediate.

10.4 **Obligations on Termination.** Upon termination or revocation of protection, Licensee must:  
  a. Immediately cease all use of the Software and affected Derivative Programs;  
  b. Delete and destroy all copies, distributions, containers, and artifacts containing the Software or Derivative Programs under Licensee’s control;  
  c. Provide written certification of deletion and cessation within seven (7) days of request.

10.5 **Public Notice of Revocation.** SyloraQ may publicly declare that a Program and its derivatives are no longer protected, and Licensee must include a clear visible notice in any affected program UI, documentation, or distribution channels indicating loss of SyloraQ protection.

---

## 11. CHAIN-PROTECTION, PROPAGATION & ENFORCEMENT

11.1 **Propagation Requirement.** Every Derivative Program must include the full text of this Agreement (or an unalterable machine-readable reference to it) and must present a terms notice to immediate downstream users that includes: (a) the Malicious Use prohibitions; (b) required attribution; (c) the liability and indemnity provisions; and (d) the conditional protection rules (Section 10).

11.2 **Downstream Enforcement.** Each Immediate Creator must contractually bind their downstream users to the same obligations and propagation requirements. Licensee must implement reasonable technical and administrative controls to enforce restrictions (e.g., EULA acceptance, API keys with terms, package manifest warnings).

11.3 **Protection While Compliant.** Upstream developers (including SyloraQ and any non-violating Immediate Creator) are protected from liability for wrongful acts of downstream users **so long as** they have:  
  a. Complied with propagation obligations;  
  b. Notified downstream users of prohibitions and liability allocations; and  
  c. Taken reasonable steps to respond to known violations (e.g., revocation of keys, takedown requests).

11.4 **Effective Depth & Unlimited Chain.** These propagation and protection rules apply at unlimited depth: any Program distributed within the Protected Chain must continue the propagation obligations to preserve protection for upstream participants.

11.5 **Exception for Authorized Security Research.** If Licensee wishes to perform security research that could produce potentially harmful outputs, Licensee must obtain prior written authorization from SyloraQ and comply with mutually agreed safe-harbor procedures. Unauthorized security research that results in Malicious Use is a Material Breach.

11.6 **Status Disclosure.** Any Program that loses protection per Section 10 must clearly and conspicuously disclose its unprotected status to all downstream users and distribution channels.

---

## 12. AUDITS & COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION

12.1 **Audit Rights.** SyloraQ (or its designated agent) may, with reasonable notice except where Malicious Use is suspected, audit Licensee’s compliance with this Agreement (including deployed cloud images, container registries, artifact repositories, and distribution manifests). Licensee must cooperate and provide access to records reasonably required.

12.2 **Certification.** Licensee must provide written certification of compliance (format provided by SyloraQ) on reasonable request, including confirmation that: (a) the license text is propagated; (b) attribution is present; (c) measures are in place to prevent Malicious Use.

12.3 **Remedies.** Failure to cooperate with audits or to provide certification constitutes a material breach and may result in revocation consistent with Section 10.

---

## 13. DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY OBLIGATIONS

13.1 **No Automatic Data Collection.** SyloraQ does not automatically collect data from Licensee by reason of distribution of the Software.

13.2 **Licensee Responsibilities.** Licensee is responsible for securely handling keys, credentials, and user data. Licensee must implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards consistent with industry standards.

13.3 **Breach Notification.** Licensee must notify SyloraQ within seventy-two (72) hours of discovering a security incident or personal data breach affecting the Software or Derivative Programs.

---

## 14. EXPORT CONTROLS & LEGAL COMPLIANCE

14.1 **Export Compliance.** Licensee shall comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations. Licensee shall not export, re-export or transfer the Software to prohibited persons, entities, or locations.

14.2 **Legal Compliance.** Licensee must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in its use of the Software.

---

## 15. SAFETY-CRITICAL SYSTEMS

---

## 16. SEVERABILITY & REFORMATION

16.1 **Severability.** If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement remains in effect. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid provision by a valid provision that most closely approximates the economic intent of the invalid provision.

---

## 17. GOVERNING LAW & DISPUTE RESOLUTION

17.1 **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, except where mandatory provisions of another jurisdiction apply.

17.2 **Arbitration.** Except for injunctive relief and urgent equitable remedies, disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in English. The seat of arbitration shall be a neutral location agreed by the parties; absent agreement, the seat shall be Geneva, Switzerland.

17.3 **Injunctive Relief.** SyloraQ may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in competent courts of any jurisdiction to restrain breaches (including Malicious Use) and to enforce takedowns or revocation notices.

---

## 18. NOTICES

18.1 **Notices.** Any legal notices required under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent to the addresses provided by the parties. Electronic notice (email) is effective if receipt is confirmed or not denied within 48 hours.
