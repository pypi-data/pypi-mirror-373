# Dingent

**A lightweight, user-friendly LLM Agent framework focused on simplifying data retrieval application development.**

**Dingent** is a lightweight, user-friendly agent framework whose core goal is to simplify the process of creating data-driven applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We provide a concise yet powerful toolkit, with a standout feature of automatic database connectivity. This allows you to quickly link your database with an LLM to build applications capable of intelligent Q\&A, data extraction, and analysis. For other data sources like APIs and local documents, Dingent offers a flexible framework that developers can easily extend by writing custom code.

## 🎯 Why Choose Dingent?

When building LLM data applications, developers often spend a significant amount of time on "glue code": connecting to databases, wrapping APIs, setting up frontend-backend communication... These tasks are tedious and repetitive.

**Dingent's core value lies in:**

  - **No More Repetition**: We package the best practices for backend services (LangGraph), data interfaces (**Plugin System**), a chat interface (CopilotKit), and a **full-featured admin dashboard** into a single command. You no longer need to build everything from scratch and can start writing your core business logic immediately.
  * **Configuration via UI**: Forget manually editing complex configuration files. With Dingent's integrated admin dashboard, you can manage assistants, build workflows, and configure settings through an intuitive graphical interface.
  * **Core Features Built-In**: We believe a simple and easy-to-use agent shouldn't require users to spend a lot of time maintaining plugins. Therefore, we are committed to integrating features the community deems important directly into the framework. If you think a feature is crucial, we encourage you to open an Issue or PR. This directly reflects our core mission of "making Agents simpler for users."
  * **Focused, Not Comprehensive**: Unlike other general-purpose Agent frameworks, Dingent specializes in data retrieval and Q\&A scenarios, offering a more lightweight and focused solution.
  - **Smooth Learning Curve**: You only need a basic understanding of Python to build powerful applications, without needing to be an expert in LangGraph or FastAPI. At the same time, we retain the flexibility to expand functionalities, ensuring the framework can fully support custom development when needed.

## ✨ Features

  * **Instant Project Setup**: Simply run `dingent dev` in any directory to initialize a new project.
  * **Integrated Admin Dashboard**: A powerful, React-based web interface to visually manage your assistants, workflows, plugins, and settings.
  * **Bundled Frontend**: A pre-built, standalone Next.js chat interface is included out-of-the-box. No need for manual setup or compilation.
  * **Lightweight and Easy to Use**: A clean design and a gentle learning curve let you focus on business logic rather than tedious configuration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Create and run a fully functional agent project in just a few minutes.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment has the following installed:

  * [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): A very fast Python package installer and resolver.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### 2. Initialize and Run Your Project

Navigate to an empty directory where you want to create your project and run the development server.

```bash
mkdir my-awesome-agent
cd my-awesome-agent

# Run the development server
uvx dingent dev
```

The first time you run this command, Dingent will ask if you want to create a `dingent.toml` configuration file, officially turning the directory into a Dingent project root.

The `dev` command will start all necessary services:

  * **Frontend Chat**: Accessible at [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
  * **Backend API**: Running at [http://localhost:8000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8000)
  * **Admin Dashboard**: Accessible at [http://localhost:8000/admin](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8000/admin)

Your project is now live\! You can now:

  * **Configure your application**: Open the admin dashboard at `http://localhost:8000/admin` to create assistants, build workflows, and configure your LLM settings.
  * **Add custom tools**: Place your custom MCP server plugins into the `plugins/` directory.
  * **Interact with your agent**: Start chatting with your agent through the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

A Dingent project has a simple and intuitive structure, managed automatically for you:

```plaintext
my-awesome-agent/
├── 📄 dingent.toml     # Main project config (ports, model, etc.). Marks the project root.
├── 📁 config/          # Stores all application configurations managed by the dashboard.
│   ├── 📁 assistants/
│   ├── 📁 plugins/
│   └── 📁 workflows/
└── 📁 plugins/         # Directory for your custom tool plugins (e.g., MCP servers).
```

  * **`dingent.toml`**: The single source of truth for your project's core settings. The presence of this file tells Dingent commands that they are in a project directory.
  * **`config/`**: This directory holds the configuration for your assistants, plugins, and workflows. You typically won't need to edit these files manually, as they are managed through the **Admin Dashboard**.
  * **`plugins/`**: This is where you add your own functionality. Place any MCP-compatible server in this directory, and Dingent will automatically discover and integrate it.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We created this project to make Agents simpler for users, not to build yet another complex development framework. Therefore, we warmly welcome and heavily rely on community contributions to shape the future of **Dingent**.

If a feature is important to you, we strongly encourage you to discuss it by opening a GitHub Issue or contributing code directly through a Pull Request. Our core philosophy is that the developer community should decide which features are built into the software, rather than leaving users to maintain their own plugins\!

If you share our vision and wish to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push your branch to GitHub (`git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
5.  Create a Pull Request and clearly describe the value of your feature.

We believe that through our collective efforts, Dingent can become a truly powerful and "out-of-the-box" tool.
