    """
    A distributed lock implementation using Redis.
    
    This class provides a distributed locking mechanism that can be used across
    multiple processes or servers. The lock is implemented using Redis SET with
    NX (only set if not exists) and includes proper cleanup on release.
    
    The lock uses a unique token to ensure that only the process that acquired
    the lock can release it, preventing accidental releases by other processes.

        namespace: The namespace prefix for Redis keys
