# Documentation OMERO Quay

## Guidelines

`omero-quay` is a microscopy data transport layer between data management tools (currently OMERO and iRODS) and file systems (currently SAMBA and SRB (iRODS specific file system)).

Currently, it supports the [iRODS](https://irods.org) â€” [OMERO](https://openmicroscopy.org/omero) architecture built at France BioImaging [fbi-omero](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/fbi-omero).

OMERO quay has different purposes depending on how you intend to use it, so the next sections will be divided according to the users expected profiles:

- System administrator: self-explanatory
- Advanced user: no administration tasks, but intend to import data. Possibly limited to scripts usage (see Scripts subsection in Code section)
- Developer: new functions coding, possible scripts development
