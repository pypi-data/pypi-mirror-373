# `pyearthtools.pipeline`

Create repeatable pipelines, transforming data and preparing for downstream applications.

Utilises `pyearthtools.data` to provide the data indexes, transforms to apply on data, and introduces
operations, filters, samplers and iterators.

```python
import pyearthtools.data
import pyearthtools.pipeline

pipeline = pyearthtools.pipeline.Pipeline(
    pyearthtools.data.archive.ERA5.sample(), # Get ERA5

    pyearthtools.pipeline.operations.xarray.values.FillNan(), # FillNans
    pyearthtools.pipeline.operations.xarray.conversion.ToNumpy(), # Convert to Numpy
)

pipeline['2000-01-01T00']

```
