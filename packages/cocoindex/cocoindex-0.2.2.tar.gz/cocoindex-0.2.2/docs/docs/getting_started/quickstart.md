# Build your first CocoIndex project

This guide will help you get up and running with CocoIndex in just a few minutes. We'll build a project that does:
*   Read files from a directory
*   Perform basic chunking and embedding
*   Load the data into a vector store (PG Vector)

## Prerequisite: Install CocoIndex environment

We'll need to install a bunch of dependencies for this project.

1.  Install CocoIndex:

    ```bash
    pip install -U 'cocoindex[embeddings]'
    ```

2.  You can skip this step if you already have a Postgres database with pgvector extension installed.
    If not, the easiest way is to bring up a Postgres database using docker compose:

    - Make sure Docker Compose is installed: [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    - Start a Postgres SQL database for cocoindex using our docker compose config:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/refs/heads/main/dev/postgres.yaml) up -d
    ```

## Step 1: Prepare directory for your project

1.  Open the terminal and create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir cocoindex-quickstart
    cd cocoindex-quickstart
    ```

2.  Prepare input files for the index. Put them in a directory, e.g. `markdown_files`.
    If you don't have any files at hand, you may download the example [markdown_files.zip](markdown_files.zip) and unzip it in the current directory.

## Step 2: Define the indexing flow

Create a new file `quickstart.py` and import the `cocoindex` library:

```python title="quickstart.py"
import cocoindex
```

Then we'll create the indexing flow as follows.

```python title="quickstart.py"
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="TextEmbedding")
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(
        cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path="markdown_files"))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope["documents"].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc["chunks"] = doc["content"].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language="markdown", chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc["chunks"].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk["embedding"] = chunk["text"].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc["filename"], location=chunk["location"],
                                   text=chunk["text"], embedding=chunk["embedding"])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        "doc_embeddings",
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=["filename", "location"],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name="embedding",
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

Notes:

1.  The `@cocoindex.flow_def` declares a function to be a CocoIndex flow.

2.  In CocoIndex, data is organized in different *data scopes*.
    *   `data_scope`, representing all data.
    *   `doc`, representing each row of `documents`.
    *   `chunk`, representing each row of `chunks`.

3.  A *data source* extracts data from an external source.
    In this example, the `LocalFile` data source imports local files as a KTable (table with key columns, see [KTable](../core/data_types#ktable) for details), each row has `"filename"` and `"content"` fields.

4. After defining the KTable, we extend a new field `"chunks"` to each row by *transforming* the `"content"` field using `SplitRecursively`. The output of the `SplitRecursively` is also a KTable representing each chunk of the document, with `"location"` and `"text"` fields.

5. After defining the KTable, we extend a new field `"embedding"` to each row by *transforming* the `"text"` field using `SentenceTransformerEmbed`.

6. In CocoIndex, a *collector* collects multiple entries of data together. In this example, the `doc_embeddings` collector collects data from all `chunk`s across all `doc`s, and uses the collected data to build a vector index `"doc_embeddings"`, using `Postgres`.

## Step 3: Run the indexing pipeline and queries

Specify the database URL by environment variable:

```bash
export COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost:5432/cocoindex"
```

Now we're ready to build the index:

```bash
cocoindex update --setup quickstart.py
```

If you run it the first time for this flow, CocoIndex will automatically create its persistent backends (tables in the database).
CocoIndex will ask you to confirm the action, enter `yes` to proceed.

CocoIndex will run for a few seconds and populate the target table with data as declared by the flow. It will output the following statistics:

```
documents: 3 added, 0 removed, 0 updated
```

## Step 4 (optional): Run queries against the index

CocoIndex excels at transforming your data and storing it (a.k.a. indexing).
The goal of transforming your data is usually to query against it.
Once you already have your index built, you can directly access the transformed data in the target database.
CocoIndex also provides utilities for you to do this more seamlessly.

In this example, we'll use the [`psycopg` library](https://www.psycopg.org/) along with pgvector to connect to the database and run queries on vector data.
Please make sure the required packages are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy "psycopg[binary,pool]" pgvector
```

### Step 4.1: Extract common transformations

Between your indexing flow and the query logic, one piece of transformation is shared: compute the embedding of a text.
i.e. they should use exactly the same embedding model and parameters.

Let's extract that into a function:

```python title="quickstart.py"
from numpy.typing import NDArray
import numpy as np

@cocoindex.transform_flow()
def text_to_embedding(text: cocoindex.DataSlice[str]) -> cocoindex.DataSlice[NDArray[np.float32]]:
    return text.transform(
        cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
            model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))
```

`cocoindex.DataSlice[str]` represents certain data in the flow (e.g. a field in a data scope), with type `str` at runtime.
Similar to the `text_embedding_flow()` above, the `text_to_embedding()` is also to constructing the flow instead of directly doing computation,
so the type it takes is `cocoindex.DataSlice[str]` instead of `str`.
See [Data Slice](../core/flow_def#data-slice) for more details.


Then the corresponding code in the indexing flow can be simplified by calling this function:

```python title="quickstart.py"
...
# Transform data of each chunk
with doc["chunks"].row() as chunk:
    # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
    chunk["embedding"] = text_to_embedding(chunk["text"])

    # Collect the chunk into the collector.
    doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc["filename"], location=chunk["location"],
                            text=chunk["text"], embedding=chunk["embedding"])
...
```

The function decorator `@cocoindex.transform_flow()` is used to declare a function as a CocoIndex transform flow,
i.e., a sub flow only performing transformations, without importing data from sources or exporting data to targets.
The decorator is needed for evaluating the flow with specific input data in Step 4.2 below.

### Step 4.2: Provide the query logic

Now we can create a function to query the index upon a given input query:

```python title="quickstart.py"
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool
from pgvector.psycopg import register_vector

def search(pool: ConnectionPool, query: str, top_k: int = 5):
    # Get the table name, for the export target in the text_embedding_flow above.
    table_name = cocoindex.utils.get_target_default_name(text_embedding_flow, "doc_embeddings")
    # Evaluate the transform flow defined above with the input query, to get the embedding.
    query_vector = text_to_embedding.eval(query)
    # Run the query and get the results.
    with pool.connection() as conn:
        register_vector(conn)
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(f"""
                SELECT filename, text, embedding <=> %s AS distance
                FROM {table_name} ORDER BY distance LIMIT %s
            """, (query_vector, top_k))
            return [
                {"filename": row[0], "text": row[1], "score": 1.0 - row[2]}
                for row in cur.fetchall()
            ]
```

In the function above, most parts are standard query logic - you can use any libraries you like.
There're two CocoIndex-specific logic:

1.  Get the table name from the export target in the `text_embedding_flow` above.
    Since the table name for the `Postgres` target is not explicitly specified in the `export()` call,
    CocoIndex uses a default name.
    `cocoindex.utils.get_target_default_name()` is a utility function to get the default table name for this case.

2.  Evaluate the transform flow defined above with the input query, to get the embedding.
    It's done by the `eval()` method of the transform flow `text_to_embedding`.
    The return type of this method is `NDArray[np.float32]` as declared in the `text_to_embedding()` function (`cocoindex.DataSlice[NDArray[np.float32]]`).

### Step 4.3: Add the main script logic

Now we can add the main logic to the program. It uses the query function we just defined:

```python title="quickstart.py"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize CocoIndex library states
    cocoindex.init()

    # Initialize the database connection pool.
    pool = ConnectionPool(os.getenv("COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL"))
    # Run queries in a loop to demonstrate the query capabilities.
    while True:
        try:
            query = input("Enter search query (or Enter to quit): ")
            if query == '':
                break
            # Run the query function with the database connection pool and the query.
            results = search(pool, query)
            print("\nSearch results:")
            for result in results:
                print(f"[{result['score']:.3f}] {result['filename']}")
                print(f"    {result['text']}")
                print("---")
            print()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            break
```

It interacts with users and search the database by calling the `search()` method created in Step 4.2.

### Step 4.4: Run queries against the index

Now we can run the same Python file, which will run the new added main logic:

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

It will ask you to enter a query and it will return the top 5 results.
