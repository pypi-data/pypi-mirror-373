# MirrorBox üöÄ

**A smart, caching proxy for Docker, designed to bypass registry restrictions and accelerate your image pulls.**

MirrorBox is a modern command-line tool that acts as a smart gateway for Docker. It intelligently routes your Docker image requests through the fastest available mirrors, caches images locally for offline access, and seamlessly integrates with your development workflow.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Accelerated Image Pulls:** Automatically benchmarks and selects the fastest, most reliable mirror before every download, dramatically speeding up `docker pull`.
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Docker Compose Integration:** Replace `docker-compose up` with `mirrorbox compose up`. MirrorBox pre-fetches all required images for your services, ensuring your projects start without delay.
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Local Caching:** Pulled images are automatically cached locally. Subsequent requests are served instantly from your disk, saving bandwidth and enabling offline work.
- ‚úÖ **Full Cache Management:** Simple commands to `list`, `save`, and `remove` cached images.
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Control:** Customize MirrorBox. Set a `priority_mirror` to always use your favorite registry first.
- ‚úÖ **Complete Docker Integration:** List all images currently in your Docker daemon with `list-images`.
- ‚úÖ **Live Monitoring & Reporting:** Get a live dashboard of mirror statuses with `monitor start` and review performance history with `report show`.
