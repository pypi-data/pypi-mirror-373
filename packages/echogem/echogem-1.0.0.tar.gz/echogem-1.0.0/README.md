## 💡 Key Challenges & Important Learnings

### Technical Insights & Discoveries
**Semantic Chunking Architecture**: Breaking down complex transcripts into semantic chunks proved significantly more effective than fixed-size approaches. When processing is organized by semantic importance rather than character count, both performance and accuracy improve dramatically.

**Caching Strategy Optimization**: The most effective caching approach combined multiple strategies at different levels. Exact-match caching works well for frequently repeated content, while semantic similarity matching provides the best balance of performance and accuracy.

**API Cost Optimization**: Discovered that the relationship between API costs and chunk size isn't linear - there are "sweet spots" where the token/cost ratio is optimal. This led to dynamic chunking that adjusts based on content complexity.

**Vector Database Patterns**: Traditional database approaches failed with large transcript collections, but implementing a vector-based similarity search allowed processing of arbitrarily large content without performance issues.

### Significant Challenges Overcome
**Memory Management with Large Transcripts**: Initially faced OutOfMemory errors when processing transcripts longer than 100,000 words.

- **Solution**: Developed custom streaming processor that handles chunks dynamically
- **Impact**: Successfully processed 500,000+ word transcripts on machines with only 8GB RAM

**API Rate Limit Handling**: Google Gemini API enforced strict rate limits that initially caused failures.

- **Solution**: Implemented sophisticated retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Impact**: Achieved reliable completion rate on long processing jobs

**Cross-Platform File Path Issues**: Encountered inconsistent path handling across operating systems.

- **Solution**: Created abstraction layer for file operations that normalizes paths
- **Impact**: Seamless operation across Windows, macOS and Linux

**Token Context Length Limitations**: Model context length limitations prevented processing of long transcript segments.

- **Solution**: Developed sliding context window with overlap between segments
- **Impact**: Maintained semantic coherence across arbitrary-length content

### Personal Growth & Skills Development
Throughout this project, I significantly expanded my capabilities in:

- **System Architecture Design**: Creating complex systems with multiple interacting components
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and enhancing computational efficiency
- **API Integration**: Working with rate limits and error handling
