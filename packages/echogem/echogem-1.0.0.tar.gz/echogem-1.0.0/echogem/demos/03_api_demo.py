        Lecture: Introduction to Quantum Computing
        Professor: Dr. Elena Rodriguez
        Date: March 15, 2024
        
        Today we'll explore the fundamental principles of quantum computing. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in superposition states.
        
        The key principles we'll cover are:
        1. Superposition: A qubit can be in multiple states simultaneously
        2. Entanglement: Qubits can be correlated in ways classical bits cannot
        3. Interference: Quantum states can interfere constructively or destructively
        
        Let's start with superposition. Imagine a coin that's spinning. While it's spinning, it's neither heads nor tails - it's in a superposition of both states. When we measure it, the superposition collapses to one definite state.
        
        In quantum computing, we can create algorithms that exploit superposition to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers is a famous example.
        
        However, quantum computers are not universally faster. They excel at specific problems like:
        - Factoring large numbers
        - Searching unsorted databases
        - Simulating quantum systems
        - Optimization problems
        
        The main challenges in building quantum computers are:
        - Decoherence: Quantum states are fragile and easily disturbed
        - Error correction: We need sophisticated error correction codes
        - Scalability: Adding more qubits increases complexity exponentially
        
        Despite these challenges, we've made remarkable progress. IBM has built quantum computers with over 100 qubits, and Google achieved quantum supremacy in 2019.
        
        Next week, we'll dive deeper into quantum algorithms and see how they work in practice.

        Q1 2024 Business Review
        Presenter: Sarah Johnson, CEO
        Date: April 10, 2024
        
        Good morning everyone. Let me start by thanking the entire team for an outstanding Q1 performance. We've exceeded our targets across all key metrics.
        
        Financial Highlights:
        - Revenue: $12.4M (up 23% from Q4 2023)
        - Profit margin: 18.7% (up 2.1 percentage points)
        - Customer acquisition cost: $45 (down 15%)
        - Customer lifetime value: $890 (up 12%)
        
        Product Performance:
        Our flagship product, DataFlow Pro, saw 34% growth in active users. The new AI-powered analytics features launched in February have been particularly well-received, with 78% adoption rate among enterprise customers.
        
        The mobile app redesign resulted in:
        - 45% increase in daily active users
        - 28% improvement in session duration
        - 67% reduction in crash rate
        
        Market Expansion:
        We successfully entered three new markets:
        1. Southeast Asia - 15% of Q1 revenue
        2. Latin America - 12% of Q1 revenue
        3. Eastern Europe - 8% of Q1 revenue
        
        Team Growth:
        We've added 23 new team members across engineering, sales, and customer success. Our employee satisfaction score is 4.8/5, up from 4.6 last quarter.
        
        Challenges and Opportunities:
        The main challenge is scaling our infrastructure to handle the increased load. We're investing $2M in cloud infrastructure upgrades this quarter.
        
        Opportunities include:
        - Expanding our AI capabilities
        - Developing industry-specific solutions
        - Building strategic partnerships
        
        Q2 Goals:
        - Achieve $15M revenue target
        - Launch enterprise security features
        - Expand to two additional markets
        - Maintain 4.8+ employee satisfaction score
        
        I'm confident we can achieve these goals with the incredible team we have.

        EchoGem API Reference
        Version: 1.0.0
        Last Updated: April 2024
        
        Overview:
        EchoGem is a Python library for intelligent transcript processing and question answering. It uses advanced NLP techniques to chunk transcripts semantically and provides a powerful query interface.
        
        Core Components:
        
        1. Processor Class
        The main interface for transcript processing and querying.
        
        Methods:
        - process_transcript(text, options): Process and chunk a transcript
        - query(question, options): Query the knowledge base
        - get_statistics(): Get processing statistics
        
        2. Chunker Class
        Handles text chunking with various strategies.
        
        Methods:
        - chunk_text(text, options): Create semantic chunks
        - analyze_chunks(chunks): Analyze chunk quality and relationships
        
        3. Vector Store Classes
        Manage storage and retrieval of chunks and Q&A pairs.
        
        ChunkVectorDB:
        - add_chunks(chunks): Store new chunks
        - search_chunks(query, limit): Find relevant chunks
        - get_chunk(id): Retrieve specific chunk
        
        PromptAnswerVectorDB:
        - add_pa_pair(pair): Store Q&A pair
        - search_pa_pairs(query, limit): Find relevant Q&A pairs
        
        4. Usage Cache
        Tracks how chunks and Q&A pairs are used.
        
        Methods:
        - record_chunk_access(chunk_id): Log chunk usage
        - get_usage_statistics(): Get usage analytics
        - export_usage_data(): Export usage data
        
        Configuration:
        Environment variables:
        - GOOGLE_API_KEY: Required for Gemini integration
        - PINECONE_API_KEY: Required for vector storage
        - PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT: Pinecone environment
