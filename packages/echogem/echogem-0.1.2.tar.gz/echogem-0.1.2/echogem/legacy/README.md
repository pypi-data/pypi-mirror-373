# Legacy Code and Development History

This folder contains 15 files that document the development journey of EchoGem, showing various approaches that were tested and ultimately replaced by the current implementation.

## üéØ Purpose

The legacy folder serves several important purposes:
- **Learning Resource**: Shows different approaches and why they were chosen or rejected
- **Development History**: Documents the evolution of the codebase
- **Decision Documentation**: Explains technical decisions and trade-offs
- **Migration Guide**: Helps users understand changes between versions
- **Future Reference**: Provides insights for future development decisions

- **Why Replaced**: Crashes, generic handling, verbose, no propagation
- **Current**: Structured exceptions with logging

### 13. `13_old_configuration.py`
- **What**: Hardcoded, env-only, JSON, YAML, INI, class-based, hybrid config
- **Why Replaced**: No flexibility, security risks, complexity, dependencies
- **Current**: Environment variables + defaults

### 14. `14_old_packaging.py`
- **What**: Manual, simple setup.py, requirements.txt, Poetry, Flit, Hatch
- **Why Replaced**: No dependency management, no standards, extra tools
- **Current**: Setuptools + pyproject.toml

### 15. `15_development_notes.py`
