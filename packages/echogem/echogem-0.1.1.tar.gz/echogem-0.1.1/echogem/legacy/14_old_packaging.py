# Legacy: Old Packaging Approaches (v0.1.0-rc12)
# Different packaging and distribution strategies tested
# Replaced by current setuptools + pyproject.toml approach in v0.2.0

import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Approach 1: Manual Installation (Early Development)
"""
Early development had no packaging - users had to:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies manually
3. Add the directory to PYTHONPATH
4. Import modules directly

This was problematic because:
- No dependency management
- Hard to install
- No version control
- Manual setup required
"""

# Approach 2: Simple Setup.py
"""
setup.py (v0.1.0-alpha):
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="echogem",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "google-generativeai",
        "pinecone-client",
        "sentence-transformers",
        "pandas",
        "numpy"
    ],
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "echogem=echogem.cli:main"
        ]
    }
)

Problems:
- No modern Python packaging standards
- Missing metadata
- No development dependencies
- No build system specification
"""

# Approach 3: Requirements.txt Only
"""
requirements.txt (v0.1.0-beta):
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
pinecone-client>=2.2.0
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

Problems:
- No package metadata
- No entry points
- No version specification
- Just a list of dependencies
"""

# Approach 4: Poetry-Based Packaging
"""
pyproject.toml (Poetry approach):
[tool.poetry]
name = "echogem"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Transcript processing and Q&A library"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

pytest = "^7.0.0"
black = "^22.0.0"
flake8 = "^5.0.0"

[tool.poetry.scripts]
echogem = "echogem.cli:main"

Problems:
- Additional dependency (Poetry)
- Different workflow than standard pip
- Learning curve for users
- Not as widely adopted as setuptools
"""

# Approach 5: Flit-Based Packaging
"""
pyproject.toml (Flit approach):
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core>=3.2"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

[project]
name = "echogem"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Transcript processing and Q&A library"

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=22.0.0",
    "flake8>=5.0.0",
]

Problems:
- Additional dependency (Flit)
- Less mature than setuptools
- Different configuration format
"""

# Approach 6: Hatch-Based Packaging
"""
pyproject.toml (Hatch approach):
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["echogem"]

Problems:
- Additional dependency (Hatch)
- More complex configuration
- Different workflow than standard tools
"""

# Approach 7: Multi-Format Packaging
"""
Attempted to support multiple packaging formats:

setup.py:
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="echogem",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "google-generativeai>=0.3.0",

    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "echogem=echogem.cli:main"
        ]
    }
)

pyproject.toml:
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "echogem"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Transcript processing and Q&A library"
# ... rest of configuration

google-generativeai>=0.3.0
pinecone-client>=2.2.0
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

Problems:
- Duplicate configuration
- Maintenance overhead
- Potential inconsistencies
- Confusing for users
"""

# Approach 8: Minimal Packaging
"""
Minimal setup.py approach:
from setuptools import setup

setup(

    py_modules=["chunker", "vector_store", "processor"],
    install_requires=[

        "pinecone-client",
        "sentence-transformers",
        "pandas",
        "numpy"
    ]
)

Problems:
- No package structure
- Flat module layout
- No entry points
- Limited functionality
"""

# CURRENT APPROACH: Modern Setuptools + pyproject.toml
# ===================================================

"""
Current approach uses:
- pyproject.toml for build system specification

- Proper entry points
- Development dependencies

Benefits:
- Standard Python packaging
- No additional tools required
- Modern standards compliance
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Works with all Python tools
