    """
    Attributes:
        confidence (Union[Unset, float]): The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the segmentation.
            Segments of the song which are difficult to logically segment (e.g: noise) may correspond to low values in this
            field.
             Example: 0.435.
        duration (Union[Unset, float]): The duration (in seconds) of the segment. Example: 0.19891.
        loudness_end (Union[Unset, float]): The offset loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). This value should be
            equivalent to the loudness_start of the following segment.
        loudness_max (Union[Unset, float]): The peak loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). Combined with
            `loudness_start` and `loudness_max_time`, these components can be used to describe the "attack" of the segment.
            Example: -14.25.
        loudness_max_time (Union[Unset, float]): The segment-relative offset of the segment peak loudness in seconds.
            Combined with `loudness_start` and `loudness_max`, these components can be used to desctibe the "attack" of the
            segment. Example: 0.07305.
        loudness_start (Union[Unset, float]): The onset loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). Combined with
            `loudness_max` and `loudness_max_time`, these components can be used to describe the "attack" of the segment.
            Example: -23.053.
        pitches (Union[Unset, list[float]]): Pitch content is given by a “chroma” vector, corresponding to the 12 pitch
            classes C, C#, D to B, with values ranging from 0 to 1 that describe the relative dominance of every pitch in
            the chromatic scale. For example a C Major chord would likely be represented by large values of C, E and G (i.e.
            classes 0, 4, and 7).

            Vectors are normalized to 1 by their strongest dimension, therefore noisy sounds are likely represented by
            values that are all close to 1, while pure tones are described by one value at 1 (the pitch) and others near 0.
            As can be seen below, the 12 vector indices are a combination of low-power spectrum values at their respective
            pitch frequencies.
            ![pitch vector](https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Pitch_vector.png)
             Example: [0.212, 0.141, 0.294].
        start (Union[Unset, float]): The starting point (in seconds) of the segment. Example: 0.70154.
        timbre (Union[Unset, list[float]]): Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes
            different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex notion also referred to as sound color,
            texture, or tone quality, and is derived from the shape of a segment’s spectro-temporal surface, independently
            of pitch and loudness. The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around
            0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.

            For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes
            brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger
            attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
            ![timbre basis functions](https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png)

            The actual timbre of the segment is best described as a linear combination of these 12 basis functions weighted
            by the coefficient values: timbre = c1 x b1 + c2 x b2 + ... + c12 x b12, where c1 to c12 represent the 12
            coefficients and b1 to b12 the 12 basis functions as displayed below. Timbre vectors are best used in comparison
            with each other.
             Example: [42.115, 64.373, -0.233].
