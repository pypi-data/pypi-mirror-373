"""Evaluation metrics for dimensionality reduction quality assessment.

This module provides evaluation functions for assessing the quality
of dimensionality reduction embeddings. It includes both ranking-based and
distance-based metrics to evaluate how well the low-dimensional representation
preserves the structure and relationships from the high-dimensional space.

The implementation includes adaptations from the pyDRMetrics package by
Yinsheng Zhang, with optimizations for runtime efficiency and integration
with the moddr pipeline.

    This function extracts metadata and/or metrics from EmbeddingState objects
