## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** installed on your system
2. **uv** package manager installed ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
3. **Reddit API credentials** (see setup section below)

## Reddit API Setup

1. **Create a Reddit App**:

   - Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
   - Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
   - Choose "script" for the app type
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - Name: Your app name (e.g., "Reddit MCP Tool")
     - Description: Brief description
     - About URL: Can be blank
     - Redirect URI: http://localhost:8080 (required but not used)

2. **Get Your Credentials**:
   - **Client ID**: Found under your app name (short string)
   - **Client Secret**: Found in the app details (longer string)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd reddit-mcp-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Quick setup (recommended)**:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/setup.py
   ```

   This will create your `.env` file and show you what to do next.

4. **Manual setup**:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your Reddit API credentials:

   ```env
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=reddit-mcp-tool:v0.2.0 (by /u/yourusername)
   ```

5. **Test your setup**:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/test_basic.py
   ```

   **Note**: This server operates in read-only mode and only requires the client ID, secret, and user agent for basic API access.

  "mcpServers": {
    "reddit-mcp-tool": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "reddit-mcp-tool"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/reddit-mcp-tool",
      "env": {

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:

- Invalid subreddit names
- Post not found
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting
- Network errors

All errors are returned as descriptive text content through the MCP protocol.

## Rate Limiting

Reddit's API has rate limits. The server respects these limits, but you may encounter rate limiting errors if you make too many requests in a short period. The default rate limit for authenticated users is typically 60 requests per minute.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
uv run black .
uv run ruff check .
```
